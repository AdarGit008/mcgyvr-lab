"""The proposal is what a stranger's install is actually bound to.

These tests run against the SHIPPED table rather than fixtures, because the
properties that matter — that the ladder does not invert, that the MoE rung
reaches a small card, that an unmeasured model is never bound — are claims
about that data as much as about this code. A fixture would let the table
drift out from under them.

The two cards are the sizes of the smallest and the largest card class the
table declares, read from it.
