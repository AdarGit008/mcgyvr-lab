"""A scoped *addition* ends its lines the way the file it is added to does.

:func:`mcgyvr.worker.scoped.apply_scoped` splices a named definition and leaves
every other byte alone. When the file has no such definition the fragment is
appended instead — the outcome the module argues for at length, because refusing
throws away work that was done correctly and substituting deletes the file.

``_appended`` built that append out of ``\\n``: ``source.rstrip("\\n")`` for the
head, ``"\\n\\n\\n"`` for the separator, and the fragment exactly as
:func:`~mcgyvr.worker.reply.parse_reply` handed it over — which is always ``\\n``,
because that parser normalises line endings on entry as a stated transformation.
On a file whose lines end ``\\r\\n`` that is wrong three times over: the
``rstrip`` leaves the head's final ``\\r`` dangling with no ``\\n`` after it, the
separator's blank lines are LF, and so is every line of the new definition.

The consequence is not a file that fails to parse — Python reads all three
terminators. It is that the file now holds two kinds of line ending, so the next
``ruff format`` (or :func:`mcgyvr.cleanup.tidy`) normalises the lot, and a change
that added one definition is reported as having rewritten every line in the file.
:func:`mcgyvr.repair._terminator` was written for exactly that failure on exactly
that reasoning — *"a repair that added one import is recorded as having rewritten
every line in the file"* — and this is the same append one module over.

So the terminator is derived the same way, from :mod:`mcgyvr.lines`, which is
where this project keeps its one definition of where a line ends. The rejected
alternative is a second derivation local to ``scoped``: that module's own
neighbour states the rule (*"a second definition of line is the same kind of
defect, and it has already cost this project twice"*), and B4 was that defect
costing it the second time.

The sources below are written as byte literals and decoded, so a reader can see
which terminator each one actually carries rather than trusting an escape inside
a triple-quoted string.

**The controls.** An LF file must come back pure LF — a fix that reached for
``\\r\\n`` unconditionally, or that converted endings in the wrong direction,
passes the CRLF statement and breaks every file this project actually edits. An
empty file must still get the fragment and no leading blank lines, which is the
one branch ``_appended``'s docstring already argues for. And the *splice* path is
asserted unchanged: ``apply_scoped`` replacing a node that exists carries the
head and tail across as the strings they already were, and
``test_fix_b4_b9_text_handling`` pins its bytes — a "normalise the whole file"
fix would pass everything here and break that.
