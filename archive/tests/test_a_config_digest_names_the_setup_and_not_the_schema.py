"""A config's identity names the setup, and a kept copy names its own contents.

Owner's ruling R2 (2026-09-06), quoted at ``src/mcgyvr/config.py:1003``: the
digest is taken over "the loaded and validated tree and never over the file's
bytes, because an identity that moved when a comment was added would name the
edit and not the setup". :meth:`Config.canonical` renders that tree *with every
default the loader filled in written out* (``config.py:960``), so the tree it
hashes is not only what the file says — it is what the file says plus whatever
the schema of the day supplies. Add one optional key to the schema and every
config that predates it renders one more line and re-identifies, with no byte
changing on disk.

That is not a typo in the code. It follows from R2 being right: if identity
covers the settings, and a new key with a default is a new setting, then the
settings genuinely changed. What is wrong is that the change is silent, that
nothing checks it, and that it leaves stored evidence whose name is a false
statement about its contents.

The evidence, read out of the live journal on 2026-09-08 after
``units.*.output_tokens`` merged:

* ``~/.mcgyvr/config/mcgyvr.yaml`` went ``cfg-a049…`` to ``cfg-6a01…`` with no
  edit to the file;
* ``<journal>/configs/cfg-ff6ea286809c40da07….yaml``, written before the key
  existed, now recomputes to ``cfg-0ae9515b37af030c…`` — the snapshot
  ``config.py:560`` documents as the way to re-select a past run's setup
  (``MCGYVR_CONFIG=<dir>/configs/<digest>.yaml``) is filed under a name that no
  longer hashes to what is inside it;
* the snapshot in the same directory that *does* declare the key still matches,
  which is what makes the first one a lie rather than a convention.

The schema change is simulated here rather than depended on. A test that
imported the real ``output_tokens`` field would pass the day someone renamed
it and prove nothing; the property is about *any* optional key nobody set, so
the tests add one to ``SCHEMA`` and hold the digest to it.

These tests pin behaviour, not a spelling. Nothing below asserts on a prefix,
a schema fingerprint or a rendering — only on which digests must be equal.
That is what makes the first test the fork: canonicalising the identity over
what a config *declares* turns it green, and making the schema visible in the
digest instead does not, because a visible prefix still moves. Choosing the
second is choosing to overrule the first, and it is worth doing on purpose
rather than by leaving a suite red.

Note that ``cfg-v1-…`` spelled from ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` (``config.py:44``) is
not one of the answers: that number is "bumped only by a breaking change to
this file's shape", and adding an optional key is not that, so the prefix would
have been unchanged the day ``output_tokens`` landed.

    """The load-bearing one. A digest names the setup, so a key nobody set is not
    part of it.

    Adding ``output_tokens`` re-identified every config on the machine that had
    never heard of it. The digest is what a journal row, a result file and
    ``MCGYVR_CONFIG`` all resolve through (``config.py:560``), so a digest that
    moves for a reason no operator can see makes two runs of one unchanged
    setup unjoinable, and makes "the config changed" unfalsifiable — which is
    the failure R2 was ruled to prevent.

    Failing this is the decision. One answer turns it green — a defaulted key
    is not identity, so the digest is taken over what the config declares. The
    other answer on the table, making the schema visible in the digest so a
    cross-schema comparison is loud rather than silent, leaves this red by
    design: it says the movement is real and must be seen. Nothing here asserts
    a spelling, so either can be argued; what cannot be argued is today, where
    the movement happens and nobody is told.
