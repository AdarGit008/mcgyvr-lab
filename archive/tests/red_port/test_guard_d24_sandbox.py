"""D24 — a task's commands run somewhere they cannot reach, holding secrets they cannot
see.

Running acceptance commands with ``shell=True`` **in the caller's live checkout**,
handing them ``os.environ`` untouched, and treating the absence of a Docker daemon
as a reason to give up on isolation entirely are each one deletion away.

So the level is chosen deliberately. ``tests/test_sandbox_tempdir.py``
asserts that one named credential is missing from one command's environment and
that one workspace path is gone after one ``with`` block. Those are the right
tests for the machinery. They are not enough, because a
replacement that scrubbed a hardcoded list of well-known keys and left
``$DEPLOY_TOKEN`` standing would pass both.

What is asserted instead:

* **The whole environment, not a named variable.** The command dumps everything it can
  see and the result is put back through the project's own predicate. A variable that is
  credential-shaped but not famous is included on purpose, because a list-based scrub is
  exactly the weaker thing, and a benign variable is asserted to survive so "scrubbed"
  cannot degrade into "empty".
* **The caller's checkout, not the workspace.** The command is destructive on
  purpose and is aimed at the file the contract targets. A sandbox that ran in
  the live tree would pass every isolation test in the suite and still eat the
  user's work, which is the failure this whole lever exists to prevent.
* **Falling back is not giving up.** Docker asked for and no daemon answering is
  the common case on a laptop and in CI. The sandbox that comes back must still
  be usable *and* still hold the hardening, and it must say out loud that it is
  weaker — a silent downgrade is how an operator ends up believing in isolation
  they do not have.
