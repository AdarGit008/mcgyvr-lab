"""D06 — a second attempt is told what the first one got wrong.

mcgyvr already owns both ends of this. :class:`~mcgyvr.escalate.RetryNotes` decides
what a note may carry and refuses three things by name; ``build_prompt(retry=...)``
renders it into the user message, last, after the output instruction. ``#43``'s own
suite holds both — ``tests/test_escalate.py`` asserts the note's contents and the
rendered prompt, and asserts the exclusions by name.

What does not exist is the middle. Nothing takes a rejected attempt, makes a note
from it, and hands that note to the next attempt. ``build_prompt``'s ``retry``
parameter has no production caller; ``Judgement.retry`` is populated by
:func:`~mcgyvr.escalate.judge` and read by nobody. So every retry mcgyvr could run
today would re-send the identical prompt to the identical model at temperature
0.0 — a second sample of a deterministic function, which is spend with a
known-in-advance result. The default of one attempt per rung is what has been hiding
it.

That is why these tests drive a **loop** rather than a note. Asserting that
``RetryNotes.of`` produces the right note is already done and would be done again
here for nothing; what is unheld is that the note reaches the next prompt. So the
attempt function is the test's, exactly as it is :func:`~mcgyvr.route.climb`'s and
:func:`~mcgyvr.escalate.escalate`'s, and what is asserted is the *prompt the second
call received*.

The first prompt is asserted too, and negatively. A loop that stapled the note onto
every prompt would pass a test that only looked at the second one, and it would
charge the first attempt of every task for a rejection that had not happened yet.

**The exclusions are the substance of the second test.** A note is worth having
because of what it leaves out: the whole gate report is roughly the size of the file
under change, and sending it back re-spends the context window telling a worker what
it already got right. Four exclusions are asserted by name, because each has its own
way of leaking back in:

* the *passing* checks — the temptation is to render the report, and a report has
  rows for what passed;
* the *observations* — findings the gate deliberately did not reject on (the
  semantic rung lives here, and #129 measured its false-positive rate as the reason
  it does), so quoting them asks a worker to change code that was never required to
  change, on the strength of a signal the gate itself declined to act on;
* the *environment issues* — a tool that was not installed, which is not something
  the worker did and not something it can fix, and which reads to a model as an
  instruction to work around a missing linter;
* and, negatively again, the first prompt.

A test that asserted only "the failing check is present" would pass against a note
that dumped all four. That is not a hypothetical failure: dumping the report is the
obvious implementation, and it is the one that makes a retry cost more than the
attempt it follows.

The third test is the verifier's half. When a reviewer refuses with remediation
notes, those notes are the entire content of what failed — the gate passed, so there
is nothing of its to repeat — and they are the most actionable thing any attempt in
this system ever produces. Losing them means the next attempt re-derives, from
nothing, a critique a model has already written down.
