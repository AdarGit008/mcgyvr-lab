"""X03 — a task asks for a *capability*, and a model is chosen on that capability.

Every shipped row of the capability table carries one quality number; a row may
also carry a ``capabilities`` vector, and :func:`mcgyvr.capability.select_for_task`
filters on the dimension the task type names.

One number is the wrong shape for the decision. A model that writes a clean docstring
and a model that gets a loop invariant right are not two points on one line, and a
ladder that ranks them on one line will send an algorithm contract to whichever model
happened to score higher on a benchmark that is mostly short functions. The lever is not
"add more numbers": it is that **the task type says which capability it needs**, and
selection filters on that capability rather than on the scalar.

Four statements, and the last two are the ones that keep this from being a
regression:

* A task type names a dimension, and two task types that ask for different things
  name different ones. Asserted with a third clause — that the dimension is not
  simply the task type's own name — because a "dimension" that is one-per-task-type
  is not a dimension at all: it would demand a measured score per task type, which
  is a table nobody has, and it would make the filter a synonym for the routing key
  it is supposed to refine.
* Selection excludes a model that is strong overall and weak on what was asked for.
  This is the whole point, and it is asserted on the *identity* of what was chosen
  rather than on a count, because a filter that returned both candidates in the
  wrong order would pass a length check.
* A model with **no** capability vector is judged on its scalar quality instead of
  being excluded. Not a nicety — every model in ``data/capability-table.json`` ships
  without a vector, so a filter that treats "no data" as "fails the floor"
  empties the pool and makes every install unroutable.
* When nothing meets the dimension, the refusal names the dimension. An operator
  told "no model is good enough" cannot act; one told which capability came up short
  can bind a rung that has it. A refusal that only said "no candidates" would pass a
  test asserting merely that the call failed, so the dimension is asserted by name.

The fixture writes its own table rather than using the shipped one, because the
shipped one has no vectors and this is about what happens when it does. It is
written from the dimension the *code* names, not from a dimension this test invents:
a test that hard-coded ``"algorithm"`` would be asserting a vocabulary that is not
mcgyvr's.

The table is handed over as a **path**, so the test also holds that
:func:`mcgyvr.capability.load` keeps the vector.
