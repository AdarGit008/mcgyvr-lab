"""D02 — a decomposition is a plan, and a plan that nothing runs is a list.

``decompose`` emits contracts and stops. Nothing orders them, nothing notices that
one of them needs another to have happened first, and nothing decides what to do when
one fails — ``propose`` is an unbound parameter and there is no driver behind it. So
today a multi-step change is handed to the operator as a pile of YAML whose only
ordering is the one the proposer happened to emit, and the first contract to fail
takes its dependants down with it silently, by writing against a file the step before
it never created.

Three statements, and they are the three decisions a driver makes.

*Order.* Asserted with the contracts handed in **reverse** of their dependency order,
because a driver that simply iterates its input satisfies any test whose fixture is
already sorted — and a proposer's emission order is not a topological sort, it is the
order a model thought of things. The dependency has to be read from the contract for
the run to be right.

*Refusal.* A contract whose dependency failed is not run at all, and this is asserted
on the dependant never having been attempted rather than on it having failed. The
distinction is spend: attempting it burns a rung's worth of tokens to produce a
guaranteed rejection against a tree that is missing the thing it was told to use, and
the rejection then looks like a worker failure in every record downstream.

*Re-planning.* After a wave with failures, what runs next must be informed by them.
Asserted two ways, because either alone is passed by the wrong thing: the failed
contract's id and the reason it failed must reach the re-planner — otherwise it
re-plans blind and re-emits the step that just failed — and the identical contract
must not be attempted a second time in the next wave, which is what a retry loop
dressed as a wave loop would do. What the re-planner is handed is inspected as
whatever it received, not as a prescribed signature: the requirement is that the
failure is named to it, not how.

Where a contract states its dependency is the port's to decide — the schema has no
field for it today, which is why that resolution is a RED failure of its own with its
own sentence. What must not drift is that the statement lives on the contract, so a
plan can be ordered before a token is spent, the way ``route.plan()`` already is.
