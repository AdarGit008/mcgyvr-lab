"""§4 — `max_replans` bounds re-planning, not the depth of a correct plan.

The pressure test's T1-E found that :func:`~mcgyvr.waves.run_waves` read
``max_replans`` as a bound on *total waves*: a correct, failure-free plan whose
dependency chain is deeper than the default of 3 was silently truncated, and its
tail reported ``blocked`` as if it had been waiting on something. The
``DEFAULT_MAX_REPLANS`` docstring states the opposite — "how many times a plan may
be re-planned before the remainder is reported" — and the rationale is spend:
each wave that re-plans pays the decomposer. A wave that simply runs the next
ready contract pays nothing, so there is no reason to cap it.

Three assertions, one for each half of the defect:

* a failure-free chain deeper than the default runs to completion, with no
  re-planner attached at all (nothing can be spending the decomposer);
* the re-planner is what ``max_replans`` bounds — a plan that keeps failing is
  re-planned exactly ``max_replans`` times, then the remainder is reported;
* when that budget runs out, a contract whose dependency *failed* is reported
  with the accurate reason ("did not land"), never "not reached" — because no
  number of further waves would have run it.
