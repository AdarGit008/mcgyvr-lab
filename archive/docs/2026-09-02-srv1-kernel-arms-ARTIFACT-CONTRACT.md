# ARTIFACT CONTRACT — srv1 kernel-arms run (2026-09-02)

What the twelve RED tests in `lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md` actually parse. Written so a
run script can emit exactly this and nothing else. Every requirement below cites
the file and line that demands it. Nothing here is invented: if a field is not
cited, no test asks for it.

Authority for syntax: `tests/sweeprows.py`.
Ground truth for line shape: `records/evidence/2026-09-01-*/**.tsv`.

**Revised 2026-09-02** after the six contradictions in §6 were adjudicated
against `lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md`'s nine guidelines. Every §6 entry now carries its
resolution, the guideline that decided it, and what changed in the parser or the
tests. Line citations were re-read against the post-resolution files.

Throughout, **⇥ denotes one literal TAB (U+0009)**. Nothing else in this document
is a tab.

---

## 1. Line syntax

`tests/sweeprows.py:225-251` (`read`) is the whole parser. There is no other.

### 1.1 Tokenisation

A file is read as UTF-8 and split into lines (`sweeprows.py:141`). For each line,
in this order:

1. **Blank / whitespace-only** → skipped entirely, but it still consumes a line
   number (`sweeprows.py:230-231`).
2. **Starts with `###`** → it is a **marker line**. It is recorded as
   `(lineno, full_line_text)` and becomes the "current marker" for every row that
   follows (`sweeprows.py:232-235`). Markers are never rows.
3. **Otherwise** → split on TAB (`line.split("\t")`, `sweeprows.py:236`). If it
   yields **fewer than 3 parts, the line is silently dropped**
   (`sweeprows.py:237-238`). A row therefore needs at least
   `host⇥label⇥kind`.
4. The first three parts are `host`, `label`, `kind`; everything after is `rest`
   (`sweeprows.py:239`).

`lineno` is 1-based over the raw file, counting blank lines and markers
(`sweeprows.py:229`). This matters: `VERDICT cited_line=` must be one of these
numbers (§2.9).

### 1.2 `key=value` fields

`rest` (the tab-separated tokens from column 4 onward) is passed to `_pairs`
(`sweeprows.py:36-42`), which tests each **whole token** against — note this is
the **row** rule; markers are stricter, see §1.6

```
_KV = re.compile(r"^([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*)=(.*)$", re.DOTALL)   # sweeprows.py:33
```

Consequences, all load-bearing:

- Fields are separated by **TAB only**. A space never separates two fields.
- A key must start `[A-Za-z_]` and continue `[A-Za-z0-9_]`. `len`, `kv`, `n`,
  `fa`, `pp`, `tg` are all legal keys.
- A **value may contain spaces, `=`, `/`, `|`, `:` — anything except a TAB**,
  because the token is a whole tab-field and the value group is `(.*)` with
  `DOTALL`. `early_stop=0/1` and `reason=CUDA error: invalid argument` are both
  one field.
- **Last duplicate key wins** within a row (`sweeprows.py:38-41`, plain dict
  assignment).
- A token that does *not* match is not an error — it goes to `tail`.

### 1.3 `tail`

```python
tail = tuple(p for p in rest if not _KV.match(p))     # sweeprows.py:247
```

`tail` is every column-4+ token that is **not** `key=value`. It is the free-text
channel: refusal reasons, crash logs, skip explanations. Two rules follow:

- A reason whose first characters happen to look like `word=` will be eaten as a
  field and vanish from `tail`. Prefix such text with a non-identifier character
  (the drivers' log lines start with a digit, e.g. `0.01.431.610 E srv ...`,
  which is safe) or keep it as `reason=` (`test_a_crash_...:37` accepts either).
- `len(" ".join(row.tail)) > 40` is asserted twice
  (`test_an_ncmoe_floor_...:87`, `test_two_backends_...:56`), so a reason must be
  at least 41 characters after joining tail tokens with single spaces.

### 1.4 What a "kind" is

`kind` is **column 3, verbatim**. There is no enum in the parser; a kind is
recognised by exact string equality or by prefix:

| construct | definition | site |
|---|---|---|
| `Sweep.of_kind(k)` | `[r for r in rows if r.kind == k]` — exact match | `sweeprows.py:195-196` |
| `Row.n` | `int(kind[2:])` iff `kind.startswith("n=")`, else `None` | `sweeprows.py:115-117` |
| `Sweep.levels()` | every row whose `Row.n is not None` | `sweeprows.py:192-193` |

So a **level row** is any row whose third column is literally `n=<int>`; its
width is parsed from the kind, not from a field. `int()` must succeed, so
`n=08` is legal, `n=8x` raises.

Kinds asserted by name in the twelve tests: `CONFIG`, `n=<int>`, `CRASH`,
`REFUSED`, `BENCH`, `SKIP`. Kinds the existing drivers also emit and that the
parser will accept unchanged: `DEGENERATE`, `WIDTH`, `ABORT`
(`lcp_sweep_31-08-2026.py:189`, `vllm_sweep_31-08-2026.py:270`,
`vllm_cores_01-09-2026.py:321`). `SKIP` is the only kind exempted from the
per-row rules (`test_a_row_that_does_not_name_its_arm_...:39-40`,
`test_a_row_without_the_rigs_live_state_...:32`).

### 1.5 Derived accessors

| accessor | rule | site |
|---|---|---|
| `Row.tag` | `label.split(" ", 1)[0]` — the label's first word | `sweeprows.py:119-123` |
| `Row.cell` | `tag` with a leading `ARM-` removed if `ARM` fullmatches `ARM_PREFIX` = `[ABL][0-9]` | `sweeprows.py:124-139`, `:49` |
| `Row.num(k)` | `float(fields[k])`; asserts the key exists | `sweeprows.py:140-143` |
| `Row.frac(k)` | `"3/8"` → `(3, 8)`; asserts the key exists | `sweeprows.py:145-150` |
| `Row.draw()` | `(num("ptok"), num("otok"))` — the work **done** | `sweeprows.py:152-167` |
| `Row.requested()` | `(num("ptok"), num("otok_req"))` — the work **asked for** | `sweeprows.py:169-183` |

**`Row.cell` strips `A0`–`A9`, `B0`–`B9` and `L0`–`L9` prefixes** — every arm
this campaign names (`lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:37-54`). `L0-d3b` and `L3-d3b` both
have cell `d3b`, so **one labelling convention, `<ARM>-<cell>`, serves every
file**. Resolved: §6.1.

**`draw()` and `requested()` are different quantities and are not
interchangeable.** §6.2.

Nothing in this module deduplicates by label (`sweeprows.py:15-16`); a label may
repeat freely.

### 1.6 Marker (stamp) lines

Two helpers, and **both can raise** — a malformed stamp is a parse error, never
a silent `{}` and never a silent truncation (§6.6, §6.7).

```python
_stamp_name(lineno, line)      # sweeprows.py:52-75  — raises ValueError
_stamp_fields(lineno, line)    # sweeprows.py:77-101 — raises ValueError
```

- A stamp's **name is the first whitespace-delimited token after `###`**.
  `### START pl1_uw=...` is `stamp("START")`. `### AB START ...` is
  `stamp("AB")` — the 2026-09-01 files' habit
  (`records/.../srv1-nomma-dp4a-ab.tsv:1`) **must not be carried over**.
- **A malformed header raises.** `_stamp_name` is called on *every* marker in the
  file, for every lookup, and raises `ValueError` when the marker has no token
  after `###` (a bare `###`) or when its first token is itself `key=value`
  (`### digest=...`, a stamp that lost its name). Both used to return `{}`, which
  is indistinguishable from "that stamp is absent" — and absence is meaningful
  here: no `### END` means the run did not close (`test_a_row_without_...:44`).
- **A stamp value may not contain a space, and one that does raises.**
  `_stamp_fields` is called only on the markers whose name matches the lookup,
  and it rejects any token after the name that is not `key=value`.
  `uptime_since=2026-09-01 08:11:08`
  (`records/.../srv1-locktest-ling-60min.tsv:1`) used to parse as
  `uptime_since=2026-09-01`, dropping the clock — so START and END compared equal
  across two different moments and guideline 7's re-read passed on a run whose end
  state was never actually read. Use a `T`-joined or underscore-joined form.
  A row field may still hold spaces; only stamps are strict.
- Markers whose name does **not** match the lookup are not field-checked, so a
  free-text marker (`### control: committed s1-d3b ...`,
  `### IMAGE ghcr.io/...`) coexists with stamps as long as its first token is not
  `key=value`.
- `Sweep.stamp(word)` returns the **LAST** matching marker in the file
  (`sweeprows.py:198-204`). `Sweep.stamps(word)` returns **all** of them in file
  order (`sweeprows.py:206-212`). `Sweep.stamped_before(row, word)` returns the
  **nearest preceding** one, `{}` if none (`sweeprows.py:214-222`).
- A missing stamp is `{}`. A *malformed* one is an exception.

### 1.7 Existence

`artifact(path, behaviour)` (`sweeprows.py:318-333`) calls
`pytest.fail(f"{rel} does not exist. {behaviour}", pytrace=False)` when the file
is absent. It never skips. The two JSON artifacts (§4) are read with a bare
`Path.read_text`, so their absence is an unhandled `FileNotFoundError`, not a
message.

Every test now reaches an artifact through `owed(name)` (`sweeprows.py:336-342`),
which looks the behaviour string up in the `BEHAVIOUR` registry
(`sweeprows.py:307-316`) — **one file, one script**. §6.5.

`RUN = records/evidence/2026-09-02-srv1-kernel-arms` (`sweeprows.py:295`).

---

## 2. Stamp blocks, by name

Only these stamp names are read by any of the twelve tests. Values shown in
`CODE` are **literal string comparisons** — the artifact must emit that exact
byte sequence.

### 2.1 `### WORKLOAD`
Read with `stamp()` (last wins) in `test_one_workload_or_no_comparison.py:55,86`.

| key | required in | value | cite |
|---|---|---|---|
| `digest` | `srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv`, `srv1-moe-slots.tsv`, `srv1-vllm-arms.tsv` | literal `2f2bb7932a0b660653def819` | `test_one_workload_...:56`; constant at `sweeprows.py:277` |
| `driver` | same three | a repo-relative path that `is_file()` and whose `workload_digest()` re-computes to `digest` | `test_one_workload_...:60-67` |
| `digest` | `srv1-llama-bench.tsv` **and `srv1-build-ladder.tsv`** | literal `none` | `test_one_workload_...:87` |
| `comparable_with` | same two | literal `microbenchmark-only` | `test_one_workload_...:91` |

`driver` must be one of the three that hash correctly today — verified green:
`vllm_sweep_31-08-2026.py`, `lcp_sweep_31-08-2026.py`, `vllm_cores_01-09-2026.py`
(`test_one_workload_...:32-46`). The path must contain no space (§1.6).
`workload_digest` execs the source region from `PROMPT_DECILES` to `def sh(`
(`sweeprows.py:280-291`), so the named driver must still contain both markers.

**Both microbenchmark files are stamped digest-free**, not only the one named
after the tool: `MICROBENCH = ("srv1-llama-bench.tsv", "srv1-build-ladder.tsv")`
(`test_one_workload_...:38`). They hold the same `llama-bench` measurement (§6.4),
and guideline 4 keeps either of them from being read as a serving claim.

Neither carries a `driver=` requirement — only the two literals above.

### 2.2 `### RIG`
Read with `stamped_before()` in
`test_a_row_without_the_rigs_live_state_is_not_comparable.py:30-32`. Required in
`srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv`, `srv1-moe-slots.tsv`, `srv1-vllm-arms.tsv`.

Every non-`SKIP` row must have a preceding `### RIG` for which `rig_gaps()`
(`sweeprows.py:270-271`) is empty — i.e. all six keys present and **non-blank
after `.strip()`**:

`cpu_max_mhz`, `ram_mt_s`, `pl1_uw`, `pl2_uw`, `driver`, `gpu_reserve_mib`
(`sweeprows.py:260-267`).

Note `driver` here is the **GPU driver version**, and it collides in name with
`WORKLOAD driver=` (§2.1) — they live in different stamps, so this is legal, but
do not merge the two stamps. Emit one `### RIG` before the first row of the file
and re-stamp per arm (`test_a_row_without_...:9-11`).

### 2.3 `### START` and `### END`
Read with `stamp()` in `test_a_row_without_the_rigs_live_state_...:43`. Required
in the same three files.

| key | rule | cite |
|---|---|---|
| `pl1_uw` | present on START **and** byte-equal on END | `:47-52` |
| `pl2_uw` | same | `:47-52` |
| `uptime_since` | same — **the value must not contain a space, and a spaced one now raises** (§1.6, §6.7) | `:47-52` |
| `cpu_max_mhz` | same | `:47-52` |
| `ram_mt_s` | same | `:47-52` |
| `pl1_source` | START only; literal `constraint_0_power_limit_uw` | `:53-57` |

`### END` must exist and be non-empty (`:44-46`). **RIG-ONLY**: the equality of
start and end is a property of the machine over the run, not of the emitter.

### 2.4 `### BUILD`
Read with `stamps()` (all of them) in two files with two different key sets.

In **`srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv`** — every `### BUILD` needs all five
(`test_a_row_that_does_not_name_its_arm_...:75-83`, unchanged):
`arm`, `commit`, `image_sha256`, `cuda_architectures`, `force_mmq`.
And `{s["arm"] for s in stamps("BUILD")}` must cover every arm that ran a
`llamacpp:b10644-` image (`:84-91`).

In **`srv1-build-ladder.tsv`** — the stamp set must cover arms `L0 L1 L2 L3 L4`
(`test_a_six_variable_diff_...:39,54-55`), and each stamp is compared on
(`test_a_six_variable_diff_...:64-70`):
`cuda_architectures`, `force_mmq`, `ggml_native`, `cpu_all_variants`, `patched`.
For each of the pairs `(L0,L1)`, `(L1,L2)`, `(L2,L3)` **exactly one** of those
five keys may differ (`:73-79`). `L4` is stamped and benched but is not on the
one-variable chain (`:73` lists only three pairs).

Safest emission: one `### BUILD` per arm carrying the **union** of both key sets
(`arm commit image_sha256 cuda_architectures force_mmq ggml_native
cpu_all_variants patched`) in both files.

### 2.5 `### KERNELS`
`srv1-build-ladder.tsv` only, read with `stamps()`
(`test_a_six_variable_diff_...:90`). Each stamp needs `arm`, plus:

| arm | `tensor_core_instructions` | cite |
|---|---|---|
| `L0` | literal `present` | `:91-95` |
| `L1` | literal `present` | `:91-95` |
| `L2` | literal `absent` | `:96-101` |
| `L3` | literal `absent` | `:96-101` |

**RIG-ONLY** — the values come from `cuobjdump` on the built libraries.

The verdict is about the ONE arch image the serve host's card loads, not about
the fat binary as a whole: L2 and L3 each hold 137748 `mma.sync` lines and every
one of them is in an sm_80 image a compute-capability-7.5 card cannot load. So a
CUDA arm's stamp also carries, and a reader may recompute the verdict from,
`device_cc`, `selected_arch`, `selected_kind` (`sass` or `ptx-jit`),
`selected_tensor_core_lines`, `mma_sync_ptx_by_arch`, `hmma_sass_by_arch`, and
the whole-binary totals under `mma_sync_ptx_all_images` / `hmma_sass_all_images`.
`source` is `cuobjdump` when the counts were baked in at build time and
`cuobjdump-recount` when they were re-measured against an older image's own
library.

### 2.6 `### BOUNDARY`
`srv1-moe-slots.tsv` only, `stamp()` (last wins)
(`test_a_crash_not_reproduced_...:63-66`).

| key | value |
|---|---|
| `arm` | literal `L2` |
| `first_failing_n` | any non-empty string (truthiness only) |

### 2.7 `### NULL`
`srv1-aa-null.tsv` only, `stamp()`
(`test_one_observation_is_not_an_effect.py:118`).

| key | rule | cite |
|---|---|---|
| `spread_pct` | non-empty, `float()`-parseable, and within `0.5` of `max((max(agg)-min(agg))/median(agg)) * 100` computed over the file's own level rows grouped by `(cell, n)` | `:118-123` |

### 2.8 `### FLOOR`
`srv1-ncmoe-floor.tsv` only, `stamps()`
(`test_an_ncmoe_floor_is_derived_and_not_copied.py:39,64`).

At least **two** stamps carrying distinct `arm` values (`:39-40`). Each stamp
needs all of (`:42-43`):
`usable_mib`, `cuda_ctx_mib`, `nonexpert_mib`, `kv_mib`, `expert_total_mib`,
`n_layers` (`:27-34`), plus `predicted` and `measured`.

The arithmetic must reproduce to within `1.0` (`:44-56`):

```
budget    = usable_mib - cuda_ctx_mib - nonexpert_mib - kv_mib
resident  = budget / expert_total_mib
predicted = (1 - resident) * n_layers
```

And no two arms reporting the same `measured` may have byte-identical tuples of
the six inputs (`:65-74`).

### 2.9 `### VERDICT`
`srv1-vllm-arms.tsv` only, `stamp()`
(`test_two_backends_on_one_checkpoint_is_the_only_pair.py:136`).

| key | value | cite |
|---|---|---|
| `hypothesis` | literal `tensor-core-emulation` | `:137` |
| `status` | one of literals `supported`, `refuted`, `unresolved` | `:138` |
| `cited_line` | `int()`-parseable, and equal to the `lineno` of some **row** in the file (not a marker, not a blank line) | `:139-143` |

Cross-rule: if any `REFUSED` row carries `arm=B2`, `status` may **not** be
`supported` (`:144-149`).

### 2.10 `### TOOL`
`srv1-llama-bench.tsv` only, `stamp()`
(`test_a_prefill_verdict_...:31`).

| key | value |
|---|---|
| `name` | literal `llama-bench` |

---

## 3. Per-row fields, by name

Every entry cites the test line that reads it. "kinds" is where it must appear.

| field | file(s) | row kinds that must carry it | cite |
|---|---|---|---|
| `arm` | `srv1-lcpp-arms`, `srv1-moe-slots`, `srv1-vllm-arms` | **every row except `SKIP`**, non-empty | `test_a_row_that_does_not_name_its_arm_...:39-41` |
| `arm` | `srv1-lcpp-arms` | level rows — groups the replicate count and the interleave order | `test_one_observation_...:45,60` |
| `arm` | `srv1-moe-slots` | `CRASH` and level rows — selects `L2` / `L3` | `test_a_crash_...:34,55,57,73,82` |
| `arm` | `srv1-vllm-arms` | `CONFIG`, `REFUSED`, level rows — keys `B1`/`B2` | `test_two_backends_...:79,80,113,126,127,144` |
| `arm` | `srv1-llama-bench` | `BENCH` — groups the `fa` coverage check | `test_a_prefill_...:67` |
| `arm` | `srv1-build-ladder` | `BENCH` — must cover `L0..L4` | `test_a_six_variable_diff_...:56-57` |
| `img` | `srv1-lcpp-arms`, `srv1-moe-slots`, `srv1-vllm-arms` | **every row except `SKIP`** | `test_a_row_that_does_not_name_its_arm_...:42-50` |
| `ptok` | `srv1-lcpp-arms` | level rows (skipped if absent) | `test_one_observation_...:88,92`; `sweeprows.py:183` |
| `otok_req` | `srv1-lcpp-arms` **and nowhere else** | level rows carrying `ptok`. **The requested output budget** — a plan, equal across arms in one `(cell, n, rep)` group. This row is the whole scope: no other file owes it, and §7 defers here | `test_one_observation_...:92`; `sweeprows.py:169-183` |
| `otok` | `srv1-lcpp-arms` | level rows. **Generated output** — an outcome; it is *expected* to differ across arms and nothing asserts otherwise (§6.2) | `sweeprows.py:152-167` |
| `otok` | `srv1-moe-slots` | `L3` level rows at the killed widths; must be `> 1` (generated, not requested) | `test_a_crash_...:92` |
| `agg` | `srv1-aa-null` | every level row | `test_one_observation_...:110` |
| `rep` | `srv1-lcpp-arms` | level rows; `int()`-parseable, defaults `"0"` if absent | `test_one_observation_...:91` |
| `n` | `srv1-moe-slots` | `CRASH` rows — `int()`-parseable, **required** (bare `r.fields["n"]`) | `test_a_crash_...:52,74` |
| `trials` | `srv1-moe-slots` | `L3` level rows at killed widths; `int()`, defaults `"1"`; the sum per `(cell, width)` must be `>= 60` | `test_a_crash_...:85-90` |
| `failed` | `srv1-moe-slots` | `L3` level rows at killed widths; `x/y` form, numerator `0` | `test_a_crash_...:92`; `sweeprows.py:145-150` |
| `http_000` | `srv1-moe-slots` | `CRASH` rows with `arm=L2`; `x/y` form with `x == y` | `test_a_crash_...:44-45` |
| `reason` | `srv1-moe-slots` | `CRASH` rows — optional; the crash marks may live in `tail` instead | `test_a_crash_...:37` |
| `pp` | `srv1-llama-bench` | `BENCH` (or level rows if any exist) | `test_a_prefill_...:34-39` |
| `tg` | `srv1-llama-bench` | same | `test_a_prefill_...:40-42` |
| `reps` | `srv1-llama-bench` | `BENCH`; `int()`, `>= 9`. **This file only** — the ladder's `BENCH` rows are the same measurement re-filed and nothing reads `reps` there (§6.4) | `test_a_prefill_...:52-55` |
| `stddev` | `srv1-llama-bench` | `BENCH`; presence only. This file only | `test_a_prefill_...:56` |
| `fa` | `srv1-llama-bench` | `BENCH`; per arm the set must contain both `"0"` and `"1"`. This file only | `test_a_prefill_...:65-71` |
| `tries` | `srv1-ncmoe-floor` | `REFUSED`; `int()`, `>= 3`, defaults `"1"` | `test_an_ncmoe_floor_...:83-86` |
| `tries` | `srv1-vllm-arms` | `REFUSED`; `int()`, `>= 3`, defaults `"1"` — guideline 8, same bar (§6.3) | `test_two_backends_...:61-65` |
| `model` | `srv1-vllm-arms` | `CONFIG`; equal on `B1` and `B2` **when both launched** | `test_two_backends_...:43,94` |
| `weights_sha256` | `srv1-vllm-arms` | `CONFIG`; equal on `B1` and `B2` when both launched | `test_two_backends_...:43,94` |
| `util` | `srv1-vllm-arms` | `CONFIG`; equal on `B1` and `B2` when both launched | `test_two_backends_...:43,94` |
| `len` | `srv1-vllm-arms` | `CONFIG`; equal on `B1` and `B2` when both launched | `test_two_backends_...:43,94` |
| `seqs` | `srv1-vllm-arms` | `CONFIG`; equal on `B1` and `B2` when both launched | `test_two_backends_...:43,94` |
| `kv` | `srv1-vllm-arms` | `CONFIG`; equal on `B1` and `B2` when both launched | `test_two_backends_...:43,94` |
| `kernel_observed` | `srv1-vllm-arms` | `CONFIG`; `"marlin" in value.lower()` for `B1`, `"exllama" in value.lower()` for `B2`. Read from the engine's `Using {Marlin,Exllama}LinearKernel for AutoGPTQLinearMethod`; an arm with no `CONFIG` is skipped | `test_two_backends_...:114-120` |
| `checkpoint_quant` | `srv1-vllm-arms` | `REFUSED` with `arm=B2`; non-empty | `test_two_backends_...:57-60` |
| `checkpoint_quant` | **every** `REFUSED` row in every file | `tools/runs/_common.sh:refused()` demands it campaign-wide. Either a value read off the checkpoint, or one of the two sentinels `none` / `unread` — see §6.3 | (emitter-side; only the vLLM row above is read by a test) |

### 3.1 The `img=` value grammar
`test_a_row_that_does_not_name_its_arm_is_not_a_measurement.py:24-29,44-50`.
A value passes iff **all** of:

- non-empty (`:43`);
- does **not** match `:(latest|main|server-cuda)$` (`:24`, `:44-47`);
- **and** one of:
  - exactly `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-cuda-b10644` (`:26`) — note this
    is *not* caught by the floating-tag regex, which is anchored at `$`;
  - exactly `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.26.0` (`:27`);
  - starts with `llamacpp:b10644-` (`:29`);
  - contains the substring `@sha256:` (`:49`).

So every locally built arm (`L0 L1 L2 L3 L4 A3`) must be tagged
`llamacpp:b10644-<suffix>`, and at least one row of `srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv` must
carry such a tag (`:74`).

### 3.2 Label rules

**One convention, every file: the label is `<ARM>-<cell> <settings...>`.** With
`ARM_PREFIX = [ABL][0-9]` (§1.5) the arm is in the label *and* the cell aligns
across arms, which is what the two rules below each needed and could not both
get before (§6.1).

- `srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv`: **no label may be used by two different `arm=` values**
  across level rows (`test_a_row_that_does_not_name_its_arm_...:54-63`). Satisfied
  because the arm is the label's prefix: `L0-d3b np=8 ...` ≠ `L2-d3b np=8 ...`.
- `srv1-moe-slots.tsv`: `test_a_crash_...:78-84` matches an `L3` row to an `L2`
  crash by `Row.cell` equality. Satisfied because `L2-mling` and `L3-mling` both
  have cell `mling`. **Do not** share the raw label across the two arms — that
  would break the lcpp-arms rule if the same emitter is reused, and it is no
  longer needed.
- At least **two distinct cells** must appear among `srv1-moe-slots.tsv`'s `CRASH`
  and level rows (`test_a_crash_...:100-101`). Note this is now a real check: with
  the old parser `L2-mling` and `L3-mling` counted as two cells, so **one**
  checkpoint driven under two arms would have passed a test about **two**
  checkpoints. It no longer does.

### 3.3 Ordering rules (`srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv`)

- Every `(arm, cell, n)` triple must appear **at least 5 times**
  (`test_one_observation_...:36,40-49`).
- Over the file's level rows in order, the number of arm-runs
  `1 + count(a != b for adjacent pairs)` must be `>= len(distinct arms) * 5`
  (`:59-65`). Concatenating whole per-arm blocks fails this; the emitter must
  interleave at row granularity.
- Every `(cell, n, rep)` group must contain exactly one distinct
  **`(ptok, otok_req)`** pair — `Row.requested()`, the work asked for (`:70-99`).
  `otok` is not compared: it is what came back. Resolved: §6.2.

## 4. The artifact files

**Nine files. Seven TSV, two JSON.** The `behaviour` string is printed verbatim
in the RED failure message (`sweeprows.py:329-332`). It now lives in **one**
place, the `BEHAVIOUR` registry (`sweeprows.py:307-316`), reached through
`owed(name)` (`:336-342`) — one artifact, one script (§6.5).

| file | `behaviour` string | cite |
|---|---|---|
| `srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv` | `run tools/runs/srv1-kernel-arms.sh` | `sweeprows.py:308` |
| `srv1-moe-slots.tsv` | `run tools/runs/srv1-moe-slots.sh` | `sweeprows.py:309` |
| `srv1-vllm-arms.tsv` | `run tools/runs/srv1-vllm-arms.sh` | `sweeprows.py:310` |
| `srv1-llama-bench.tsv` | `run tools/runs/srv1-llama-bench.sh` | `sweeprows.py:311` |
| `srv1-build-ladder.tsv` | `run tools/runs/srv1-build-ladder.sh` | `sweeprows.py:312` |
| `srv1-aa-null.tsv` | `run tools/runs/srv1-aa-null.sh` | `sweeprows.py:313` |
| `srv1-ncmoe-floor.tsv` | `run tools/runs/srv1-ncmoe-floor.sh` | `sweeprows.py:314` |
| `placement-null.json` | *(none — read with `Path.read_text`)* | `test_placement_...:38,52` |
| `correctness.json` | *(none — read with `Path.read_text`)* | `test_a_faster_arm_...:32,50` |

The seven shell scripts named — `srv1-kernel-arms.sh`, `srv1-moe-slots.sh`,
`srv1-vllm-arms.sh`, `srv1-llama-bench.sh`, `srv1-build-ladder.sh`,
`srv1-aa-null.sh`, `srv1-ncmoe-floor.sh` — now exist in `tools/runs/`, beside
`_common.sh`, the one emitter they all source. Nothing asserts they exist; the
strings are message text only. They map onto the campaign's step list
(`lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:111-128`) one script per step, which is why the file is
announced as the output of the step that produces it and not of the campaign.
The enforced order across all eight is in `RUN-ORDER.md`, beside this file.

### 4.3 One file, one owner-creator — `srv1-moe-slots.tsv`

Two scripts write `srv1-moe-slots.tsv`: `srv1-moe-slots.sh` puts step 6's
placement rows in it, `srv1-kernel-arms.sh --step crash` puts step 7's crash
rows in it. §4 gives the file exactly one behaviour string —
`run tools/runs/srv1-moe-slots.sh` — so that script is the **owner-creator** and
the other is the **appender**, and the order is **step 6, then step 7**.

| script | role | on the file |
|---|---|---|
| `srv1-moe-slots.sh` (step 6) | owner-creator | creates it, truncating any previous copy. Refuses to start if it already exists unless `--force` |
| `srv1-kernel-arms.sh --step crash` (step 7) | appender | appends only. Refuses to start unless the file exists **and** already carries `### INSTRUMENT step=6` |

Both checks run before any rig work, so an out-of-order invocation costs nothing
and leaves nothing behind. This is enforced in the scripts, not documented at
them: run the appender first and it exits non-zero having written no byte. The
alternative — letting either create the file — produces a legal-looking artifact
whose only `### WORKLOAD`/`### START` block came from the crash study and whose
placement rows sit under an `### END`. `Sweep.stamp()` takes the last of each,
so the parser would read that half file without complaint.

Each writer emits its own `### WORKLOAD`, `### START`, `### RIG` and `### END`,
and its own `### INSTRUMENT` naming which tool produced the rows that follow it.
`stamp()` takes the last of each and `stamped_before()` the nearest preceding,
so both blocks resolve when they are in the right order.

### 4.1 `placement-null.json`
`test_placement_is_not_declared_output_neutral_without_a_measurement.py:50-89`.
Top-level object with:
`model` (truthy), `tier` (truthy), `cells`,
`run_a` and `run_b`, each an object with `n_cpu_moe` and `serving_build` — the
two `n_cpu_moe` values as a set must equal `{0, 99}` (**integers**, `:54`) and
the two `serving_build` values must be equal (`:57`);
`flips == 0` (`:60`); `acceptance_drift == 0` (`:65`);
`bound` — an object with `serving_build` equal to `run_a.serving_build` (`:84`)
and `cells` equal to the top-level `cells` (`:88`).

### 4.2 `correctness.json`
`test_a_faster_arm_that_answers_differently_has_not_won.py:48-95`.
Top-level object with:
`arms` — a list; each entry has `arm`, `serving_build`, `cells`, `drift_pp`,
`acceptance_drift == 0`, optional `is_reference` (**exactly one** entry truthy,
`:80-83`), and `self_null` — an object with `serving_build` equal to the arm's
(`:65`), `cells` equal to the arm's (`:70`), and `bound_pp` (`:87`);
`verdicts` — a list; each entry has `question` and `winner`, and every `winner`
must appear in `{a["arm"] for a in arms}` (`:51-57`).
Since 2026-09-02 each arm entry also carries `image` (the tag the step served)
and `endpoint` (the step's own, `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`), and `serving_build`
is `llama.cpp@<tag>@<digest>` as resolved by `image_digest` — derived by the
step that started the container, never typed by the caller. Not read by the
test; recorded so a row can be traced to the image that answered it.
For every non-reference arm, `drift_pp <= max(own bound_pp, reference bound_pp)`
(`:87-92`).

Ten level rows over two arms give `blocks = 10 >= 2 * 5` (`:63`) and five
replicates each (`:47`). `L0-d3b` and `L2-d3b` now share cell `d3b`, so each
`(d3b, 1, rep)` group holds **both** arms' rows and the requested-draw check
(`:93`) is a real comparison: the two rows must agree on `ptok` and `otok_req`.
They need not agree on `otok`, and are not expected to.

Labels carry the arm and the **cell** is shared across `L2` and `L3`:
`L2-mling` and `L3-mling` both resolve to cell `mling` (§1.5, §3.2). `L2` must be
present at every width `n=1..12` — as a `CRASH` row with `n=` or as a level row
(`:51-62`). Two distinct **cells** minimum (`:101`), which means two checkpoints,
not two arms.

```

`cited_line=6` is the `lineno` of the first `CONFIG` row above (lines 1-3 are
markers). Recount it whenever the file changes — the check is exact (`:139-143`).

The pair is `--linear-backend marlin` (B1) against `--linear-backend exllama`
(B2) on one checkpoint. `kernel_observed=` is parsed from the engine's
`Using {Marlin,Exllama}LinearKernel for AutoGPTQLinearMethod`.

**If `B2` never launches** — srv1 holds no GPTQ file, so the arm is behind a
fetch and may still be refused — drop both its `CONFIG` row and its level row and
emit a refusal instead (§6.3):

```
srv1⇥B2-gptq util=0.90 len=2048 seqs=8 kv=auto⇥REFUSED⇥arm=B2⇥img=vllm/vllm-openai:v0.26.0⇥checkpoint_quant=gptq⇥tries=3⇥0.00 ExllamaLinearKernel cannot implement due to: PLACEHOLDER reason text of at least forty-one characters
```

That row is now what a missing `CONFIG` costs: `checkpoint_quant`, a reason over
40 characters, and `tries>=3` (`:56-65`). `B1` must still have a `CONFIG`
(`:81-84`), and `status` must then not be `supported` (`:144-149`).

`ARMS = ("L0","L1","L2","L3","A3")` is declared at
`test_a_prefill_...:25` and **never referenced by any test**; no test constrains
which arms appear. The `fa` rule applies to whatever arms *do* appear (`:65-71`).
No `RIG`/`START`/`END`/`arm`/`img` per-row rules reach this file.

These rows are the campaign's step 3 (`lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:117-118`) and this
file is their authoritative record: the spread (`reps`, `stddev`) and the
`-fa 0,1` coverage are asserted here and nowhere else (§6.4).

Note `L0→L1` moves only `force_mmq`, `L1→L2` only `cuda_architectures`, `L2→L3`
only `patched` (`:73-79`). `L4` is on no checked pair. The `KERNELS` values are
**RIG-ONLY** (`cuobjdump` output); `L4`'s `KERNELS` stamp is not asserted.

The `BENCH` rows are the **same** `llama-bench` measurement as §5.4, projected to
one row per rung and re-filed beside the stamps that make the ladder readable in
one place (§6.4). They carry no `fa`/`reps`/`stddev` — nothing reads those here —
and the file is stamped digest-free, because a rung quoted as a serving gain is
exactly the misreading guideline 4 blocks.

### 5.6 `srv1-aa-null.tsv`

Read by: `test_one_observation_is_not_an_effect::test_the_instrument_was_priced_...`
only.

Requires level rows carrying `agg=`, at least one `(cell, n)` group with two or
more rows, and a `### NULL spread_pct=` within `0.5` of the observed maximum
percentage spread (`:107-123`). No `arm`, `img`, `RIG`, `WORKLOAD` rule reaches
this file. It is an A/A null, so all rows are one arm and the label prefix is
`L3-`; grouping is by `(cell, n)` and the prefix strips.

Check the arithmetic: L3 gives `(1 - (5500-400-900-700)/4000) * 28 = 3500/4000
→ 0.875 → 0.125 * 28 = 3.5`, which is **not** within 1.0 of `predicted=8.4` —
the numbers above are placeholders and deliberately do not reconcile. The run
must emit inputs that reproduce their own `predicted` to `±1.0` (`:52-56`).
**RIG-ONLY**: `measured` and the refusal text come from launches.

## 6. CONFLICTS — resolved 2026-09-02

Requirements that pulled against each other. Each is now decided, by the
guideline named, in `tests/sweeprows.py` and the twelve tests. Nothing was
weakened: every test still checks what it checked, and all twelve remain
`xfail(strict=True)` with their dated reasons — they are RED until the rig runs.

### 6.1 `Row.cell` stripped `[AB][0-9]-` but the ladder arms are named `L0`–`L4`

**Was.** `sweeprows.py` removed the tag prefix only when it fullmatched
`[AB][0-9]`, so `L0-d3b` had cell `L0-d3b` while `A3-d3b` had cell `d3b`. Two
tests then needed opposite labelling conventions:
`test_a_row_that_does_not_name_its_arm_...:54-63` wants the arm *in* the label
(no label shared by two arms), and `test_a_crash_...:78-84` wants an `L3` row and
an `L2` `CRASH` row to share a **cell**, which for `L` arms was only reachable by
sharing the whole label. One emitter could not do both.

**Decided by guideline 2** — "two rows are comparable only if `ptok` and `otok`
match". That rule pairs rows before it compares them, and the pairing key is
`(cell, n, rep)`; a cell that changes identity with the arm cannot pair anything.
Guideline 1's interleaved replicates need the same pairing to mean anything. The
`L` arms were outside it by an accident of one regex, not by intent —
`sweeprows.py`'s own docstring already said the prefix is stripped "so arms can
be aligned".

**Resolution.** `ARM_PREFIX = [ABL][0-9]` (`sweeprows.py:49`) — every arm this
campaign names (`lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:37-54`) strips. That collapses the two
conventions into one: **`<ARM>-<cell> <settings...>` on every label, in every
file** (§3.2). The arm is in the label, so no label is shared; the cell is not,
so `L2-mling` and `L3-mling` align. No test assertion changed.

**Second defect it closed.** `test_a_crash_...:100-101` asserts two distinct
cells, meaning two MoE checkpoints with different expert geometry. Under the old
parser `L2-mling` and `L3-mling` counted as two cells, so one checkpoint driven
under two arms would have passed a test about two checkpoints. It no longer does.

### 6.2 Draw-matching demanded `otok` equality that the campaign says cannot hold

**Was.** `test_one_observation_...:63-77` (pre-fix) required every `(cell, n, rep)` group to
hold exactly one `(ptok, otok)` pair, while
`test_a_faster_arm_that_answers_differently_has_not_won.py:5-8` records as the
campaign's premise that the arms run different kernels and the 2026-09-01 A/B
already reads `otok` **214 against 221 on one cell at `temperature: 0`**. Where
the cells aligned, the assertion was unsatisfiable by an honest run; where they
did not (the `L` arms, before §6.1), it was vacuous. §6.1 makes the cells align
everywhere, so this had to be settled or it would have become unsatisfiable
everywhere.

**Decided by guideline 2** — and by reading it for the quantity it names.
Guideline 2 is about **draw sync**: "the prompt draw comes from a per-process
counter; changing the level list desyncs it, measured at 6.2%". That is the work
*requested* — the prompt drawn and the output budget asked for. What test 11 is
about is **answers differing**: generated output, an outcome of the kernel. These
are two quantities that the drivers happened to print under one name.

**Resolution — they are different, and now have different names.**

- `otok_req` is new: the per-request output budget the driver asked for. A plan,
  equal across arms by construction, and therefore a real check when it is not.
- `otok` keeps its meaning: tokens actually generated. Expected to differ across
  arms; **nothing asserts otherwise**.
- `Row.requested()` → `(ptok, otok_req)` (`sweeprows.py:169-183`) is guideline 2's
  quantity and is what `test_one_observation_...:70-99` now groups on.
- `Row.draw()` → `(ptok, otok)` (`:152-167`) is unchanged and keeps its one live
  caller, `test_a_row_parser_...:72`, which uses it to show that
  `prefill/agg ≡ ptok/otok` — a statement about a single row's arithmetic, where
  the emitted count is exactly the right quantity.

Neither test was weakened: test 7 still demands matched draws, test 11 still
scores the answers through the gate against a bound each arm measured. The
campaign's own division of labour — guideline 2 for honesty, guideline 9 for
correctness — is now visible in the field names.

### 6.3 A `REFUSED` `B2` had to also produce a `CONFIG` row it never earned

**Was.** `test_two_backends_...:43` asserted `{"B1","B2"} <= set(configs)` and
`:45-48` compared seven held fields between the two `CONFIG` rows — but `:69-79`
and the file's docstring hold that `B2` may legitimately never launch, and the
drivers print `CONFIG` only *after* a successful launch and warm-up. Satisfying
`:43` for a refused `B2` meant emitting a `CONFIG` row describing an engine that
never came up, carrying a `kernel_observed=` for a kernel that never ran.

**Decided by guideline 8** — "a refusal is a result. Retry three times before
believing it, and record the reason." A result is a thing the file *says*, not a
hole it leaves. So B2 is exempt from `CONFIG`, and the exemption has a price.

**Resolution** (`test_two_backends_...:46-100`):

- `B1` must have a `CONFIG` row. It is the default Marlin path; without it there
  is no baseline and no contrast.
- `B2` must appear as **either** a `CONFIG` row **or** a `REFUSED` row. A dropped
  arm and a refused arm leave an identical hole, and only one is a result.
- The seven held fields are compared **only when both arms produced a `CONFIG`**.
- A `B2` with no `CONFIG` must clear `a_recorded_refusal()` (`:46-66`):
  `checkpoint_quant`, a reason over 40 characters, and `tries>=3` — guideline 8's
  own bar, the same one `test_an_ncmoe_floor_...:83-86` already applies, and the
  reason two REFUSED rows on 2026-09-01 turned out to be a dangling HF-blob
  symlink read as a capability limit.
- `kernel_observed` stays conditional (`:114-117`, unchanged): an arm with no
  `CONFIG` has no engine log line to read. That skip is no longer a loophole,
  because the arm it excuses has already been made to produce a refusal.

**`checkpoint_quant` is demanded on every refusal, and most refusals have no
checkpoint.** `a_recorded_refusal()` is written for the vLLM pair, where the
field carries what was read from `quantization_config`. But
`tools/runs/_common.sh:refused()` applies the same bar to every script, and a
build that never compiled, an image with no `llama-bench` in it and an arm whose
`cuobjdump` record is missing all refuse without ever loading a checkpoint. Four
spellings of that hole were in circulation across the eight scripts — `none`,
`unread`, `unread-no-quantization_config`, `unread_the_loader_never_printed_it`
— which is four ways for a reader to fail to notice they are the same fact.

**The vocabulary is exactly two words**, enforced in `refused()`, which rejects
anything that merely looks like a sentinel (`unread*`, `unknown*`,
`unrecorded*`, `n/a`, `-`, an empty value):

| value | means |
|---|---|
| `none` | **no checkpoint was involved.** Nothing was loaded, so there is nothing to read: a build failure, a missing binary, an image carrying no cuobjdump record. |
| `unread` | **a checkpoint was involved and its declared quantisation was never read.** The loader died before printing `print_info: file type`, or the repo carries no `quantization_config`. |

Anything else must be a value actually read off the checkpoint — GGUF's
`print_info: file type` line, or `config.json`'s `quantization_config`
(`lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:143-151`: a checkpoint's name is not evidence of its
format). **Which kind of unread it was belongs in the reason**, which every
refusal already owes 41 characters of, and where a reader will look for it. It
is not a third word in the field.

**Still live** (verified 2026-09-02, see `B2-CHECKPOINT.md`): `--linear-backend`
does exist in v0.26.0 with `exllama` among its choices — the August AWQ refusal
was the kernel rejecting uint4, not a missing flag — but srv1 holds **no GPTQ
checkpoint at all**, so B2 sits behind a fetch and "B2 never launched" remains an
outcome this conditional must handle. The pair is `--linear-backend marlin`
against `--linear-backend exllama`; the run doc's `--quantization gptq` vs
`gptq_marlin` fallback moves nothing in v0.26.0.

### 6.4 Two files must both carry `BENCH` rows for `L0`–`L3`

**Was.** `test_a_six_variable_diff_...:56-57` needs `BENCH` rows for `L0..L4` in
`srv1-build-ladder.tsv`; `test_a_prefill_...:52-71` needs `BENCH` rows with
`reps`, `stddev` and both `fa=0` and `fa=1` in `srv1-llama-bench.tsv`. Nothing
said whether these were one measurement or two.

**Decided by guideline 4** — "microbenchmarks carry no workload digest. File them
apart; never mix them into a serving claim."

**Resolution: one measurement, two filings, and the rule reaches both files.**
Both sets of rows are step 3 (`lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:117-118`), which the run doc
routes to tests #5 *and* #6. So:

- `srv1-llama-bench.tsv` is the **instrument record**: every `-p`/`-fa`
  combination, with `reps>=9` and `stddev`. The spread and `-fa 0,1` coverage are
  asserted here and nowhere else.
- `srv1-build-ladder.tsv` re-files a **projection** — one `BENCH` row per rung —
  beside the `BUILD` and `KERNELS` stamps, so the one-variable chain and the
  static mechanism check read in one place. It carries `pp`/`tg` and no
  `fa`/`reps`/`stddev`, because nothing reads those there.
- **Both** are now stamped `### WORKLOAD digest=none comparable_with=microbenchmark-only`.
  `test_microbenchmarks_are_filed_where_no_cross_engine_claim_can_reach_them` is
  parametrised over `MICROBENCH = ("srv1-llama-bench.tsv", "srv1-build-ladder.tsv")`
  (`test_one_workload_...:38,71-91`). Stamping only the file named after the tool
  would have left the ladder — the file a reader goes to for "what is this rung
  worth" — free to be read as a serving claim, which is the misreading that
  produced "the arch spoof is worth 1.7x".

The two files must not disagree; the ladder's rows are copied from the
instrument's, never re-measured.

**Which puts the ladder on both sides of step 3, so it runs twice, in order.**
`srv1-build-ladder.sh` builds the images step 3 benches, and then copies step
3's numbers back. One pass cannot do both. The order is enforced, not
documented:

| pass | invocation | step | writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `srv1-build-ladder.sh --stage build` | 1 | builds, gates the mechanism, writes `### WORKLOAD/START/RIG/BUILD/KERNELS/END`. No `BENCH` row, and it says so. |
| — | `srv1-llama-bench.sh` | 3 | the instrument record |
| 2 | `srv1-build-ladder.sh` (`--stage all`, the default) | 3′ | reuses the images, truncates and rewrites the file **with** the `BENCH` rows |

The default stage refuses to start when `srv1-llama-bench.tsv` is absent —
checked before a single image is built, so an out-of-order run spends no build
time and leaves no file — and it exits non-zero if any built rung ends with no
row, because a ladder missing a rung is not a ladder. `--stage build` is the one
way to get the stamps without the rows and it is explicit. Each pass truncates
and rewrites, so pass 2 leaves one whole file rather than two half ones.

### 6.5 `srv1-moe-slots.tsv` and `srv1-vllm-arms.tsv` each carried two behaviour strings

**Was.** `artifact()` was called on `srv1-moe-slots.tsv` with
`run tools/runs/srv1-kernel-arms.sh` from three files and with
`run tools/runs/srv1-moe-slots.sh` from a fourth; `srv1-vllm-arms.tsv` likewise.
The string is never compared, so nothing broke — which is why it drifted. A
reader of the RED output was told two different scripts produce one file.

**Decided by guideline 5** — "the `L`/`A` arms and the `B` arms are two studies
sharing a rig and a workload" — read together with the campaign's step list
(`lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:111-128`), which is explicitly ordered so that each step
can be run and lost independently. An artifact names the one step that produces
it, not the campaign it belongs to.

**Resolution.** One registry, `BEHAVIOUR` (`sweeprows.py:307-316`), reached
through `owed(name)` (`:336-342`). Every test now takes its artifact by file name
and cannot supply its own string. `srv1-moe-slots.tsv` → `srv1-moe-slots.sh`
(the placement null, step 6); `srv1-vllm-arms.tsv` → `srv1-vllm-arms.sh` (the vLLM
capability study, step 8); `srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv` → `srv1-kernel-arms.sh` (the
serving sweep, step 4). Full table in §4.

**And the string decides the owner.** `srv1-moe-slots.tsv` is written by two
scripts, and the one behaviour string names `srv1-moe-slots.sh`. That script
therefore creates the file and `srv1-kernel-arms.sh --step crash` only appends
to it — enforced at both ends, §4.3. A reader told to `run
tools/runs/srv1-moe-slots.sh` and finding that it refuses because the other
script got there first would be back where §6.5 started.

### 6.6 A malformed stamp header read as an absent stamp

**Was.** `parts and parts[0] == word` returned `{}` for a bare `###` line and for
a marker whose first token was `key=value` (`### digest=...`, a stamp that lost
its name). `{}` is also what an *absent* stamp returns, and absence is meaningful:
`test_a_row_without_...:44` reads a missing `### END` as "the run did not close,
or the pipe died with it". A broken emitter and a hard lock produced the same
message.

**Decided by guideline 7** — "stamp the rig on every row, and re-read it at the
end". A stamp that cannot be read is not a stamp that is missing.

**Resolution.** `_stamp_name(lineno, line)` (`sweeprows.py:52-75`) raises
`ValueError` for both cases, on every marker in the file, for every lookup.
Free-text markers still coexist (`### IMAGE ghcr.io/...`,
`### control: committed ...`) — only a *nameless* header raises.

### 6.7 A stamp value containing a space silently lost its tail

**Was.** A marker is `.split()` on whitespace, so
`uptime_since=2026-09-01 08:11:08`
(`records/.../srv1-locktest-ling-60min.tsv:1`) parsed as
`uptime_since=2026-09-01` and dropped the clock — silently. START and END then
compared **equal** across two different moments, and guideline 7's re-read passed
on a run whose end state was never actually read. That is the exact failure mode
`test_a_row_without_the_rigs_live_state_is_not_comparable` exists to catch,
passing through the parser that implements it.

**Decided by guideline 7**, same clause, and by the choice between "robust" and
"loud": a continuation rule (append a non-`k=v` token to the previous value)
would have guessed, and a guess here is a rig state nobody read.

**Resolution.** `_stamp_fields(lineno, line)` (`sweeprows.py:77-101`) raises
`ValueError` on any token after the stamp name that is not `key=value`. It runs
only on markers whose name matches the lookup, so an unrelated free-text marker
elsewhere in the file does not poison a `stamp("RIG")`. Row fields are unaffected
— a tab-delimited row value may still contain spaces (§1.2). Emit `T`-joined or
underscore-joined stamp values.

## 7. Notes for the emitter, from the existing drivers

- The three drivers print `host⇥label⇥kind⇥k=v...` today
  (`lcp_sweep_31-08-2026.py:197-224`, `vllm_sweep_31-08-2026.py:277-306`) and
  emit **none** of `arm`, `rep`, `otok_req`, `trials`, `http_000`, `model`,
  `weights_sha256`, `kernel_observed`, `checkpoint_quant`, `tries`, `pp`, `tg`,
  `reps`, `stddev`, `fa`. Every one of those is new.
- `vllm_sweep_31-08-2026.py:165` puts `util`, `len`, `seqs`, `kv` in the **label**
  only. `test_two_backends_...:43,94` reads them as **row fields**. They must be
  emitted twice, or moved.
- `vllm_cores_01-09-2026.py:202-208` prints a **five-column** row
  (`host⇥pair⇥tag⇥phase⇥n=N⇥...`), which puts the tag in the `kind` column and
  demotes `n=N` to a field. Rows in that shape are **not** level rows under
  `sweeprows.py:115-117` and will not be seen by `levels()`. Do not reuse that
  layout for any file in this contract.
- `lcp_sweep_31-08-2026.py:214` prints `n=<N>⇥ERR` on a dead cell. That is a
  level row with no `ptok`; it is skipped by
  `test_one_observation_...:88-89` but still counted by `:45` and `:60`, and it
  still needs `arm=` and `img=` under
  `test_a_row_that_does_not_name_its_arm_...:41-43`.
- Do not edit
  `records/evidence/2026-09-01-bandwidth-and-ncmoe-floor/srv1-nomma-dp4a-ab.tsv`.
  `test_a_row_parser_that_reads_nothing_proves_nothing.py:23-78` pins it at
  exactly 18 level rows, 17 with `ptok`, two `img=` values, colliding labels, and
  **no `arm=` field** (`:48-50`). It is the suite's only live exercise of the
  parser, and the only caller of `Row.draw()`.
- That file's own markers would now raise if any test read them as stamps:
  `### AB START ... uptime_since=2026-09-01 08:11:08` is `stamp("AB")` with a
  spaced value (§6.6, §6.7). No test does, and none should — the habit is not to
  be carried into this run's files.
- `otok_req` is scoped by §3 and by nothing else, and the scope is
  **`srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv`** — the only file any test reads it from
  (`test_one_observation_...:92` through `Row.requested()`,
  `sweeprows.py:169-183`). This bullet used to say "every level row in this
  run", which contradicted §3 and would have obliged the vLLM driver to emit a
  field nothing reads. Read the scope in §3; it is stated once, there.

  Where it IS emitted, it must sit alongside `ptok=` and `otok=` on the same
  level row (§6.2): it is the `max_tokens` the client asked for, an input, and
  `otok` is what came back. The drivers print the requested cap nowhere today,
  so `srv1-kernel-arms.sh` recovers it by replaying the driver's own
  `mkprompt()` call order. `srv1-aa-null.sh` emits it too, because it is the
  same emitter driving the same workload, and nothing objects to a field no test
  reads. `srv1-vllm-arms.sh` **omits** it: `vllm_sweep_31-08-2026.py` never lets
  the budget out of `post()`, and reconstructing it would be a second
  implementation of the workload standing in for a value this run did not
  measure.
