"""Citation discipline on the claims register (#118).

ADR-0004 makes a citation a load-bearing part of a claim rather than a
decoration, and the failure that made #109 expensive was citations nobody could
resolve — roughly twenty-five of them pointing into a directory gitignored in
another repository. These pin the two properties that stop that recurring.

A citation is either **vendored** (a path inside this repository, which must
exist) or **pinned** (a URL naming an immutable revision). A GitHub URL on a
branch is neither: ``blob/main/x.md`` resolves to different bytes tomorrow, and
local-ai — where most of this evidence comes from — is an unarchived personal
repository that keeps moving. The branch case is the one worth a test, because
it looks exactly like a working citation right up until it silently isn't.
