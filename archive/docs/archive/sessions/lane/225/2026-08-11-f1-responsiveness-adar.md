# `f1` responsiveness — the band is alive, and the 400 may buy less than D5 priced

Reads the run pre-registered in `2026-08-11-f1-responsiveness-prereg.md`
(committed `fd43cd0b`, before dispatch). Figures re-derive with:

```
uv run python tools/bench/responsiveness.py \
  --run records/measurements/f1-responsiveness-15b-2026-08-11 \
  --baseline records/measurements/bench-calibration-15b-f1-240-2026-08-11 --draws 8
```

Full output is kept beside the rows as `responsiveness.txt` / `.json`.

## What ran

135 `f1` bench-half problems, both arms, **9 draws per cell** — greedy draw 0
plus 8 sampled at T=0.7 — on srv2, `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b`, cap 2048, condition
`stock`, serving build **0.32.5** (the same build as both earlier reads, so
ADR-0024 comparability holds). **2,430 dispatches, 2,430 rows recorded, 0
missing cells, 0 draws lost to dispatch error.** The 105 reserve problems were
not swept. Wall clock ~65 minutes at 1.7 s per dispatch.

## Validity gate — passed, with the campaign's first greedy drift at this size

Draw 0 against the 240 sweep: **270 shared cells, greedy 105 → 104, one cell
drifted** — `ts/b387-tag-index`, which passed on the day and fails now. The
pre-registered allowance was 2, so the run is read.

That single flip is worth naming rather than rounding away, but it is **not** a
regression. ADR-0019's determinism table shows 0-task drift for this model at
**n = 20**, and 1 problem in **255** for the pool instrument at 14B. One cell in
270 is 0.37%, which is exactly the rate the larger-n instrument already showed.
Zero drift at n=20 and one at n=270 is a sample-size effect. This is now the
**fourth** free determinism check the campaign has taken and the first to have
enough cells to see a flip at all.

## Primary: the band is not arm A, and it is not close

|  cells | pinned-fail | pinned-pass | responsive |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 270 | 83 (30.7%) | 9 (3.3%) | **178 (65.9%)** |

**`psi_draw` = 0.659, 95% Wilson 0.601–0.713.** The pre-registered floor was
0.10 and the "sizing holds" threshold 0.20. This clears both by a wide margin.

The failure mode that prompted the run — a band comfortably in range by level
while nearly every cell is pinned, as the bundle's Python arm A was at 65–70%
with 5% responsive — **is ruled out for `f1`.** Two thirds of its cells can move.
Whatever else is true, this material is not an instrument that returns the same
answer to every question.

## The pre-registered test: t8 vs t4–7 pooled, pinned-fail

|  | pinned-fail | of | rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| t8 | 19 | 44 | 43.2% |
| t4–7 pooled | 54 | 190 | 28.4% |

**Fisher exact, two-sided: p = 0.071.** At the α = 0.05 declared in advance this
**does not reject**, and by the pre-registered rule that is outcome 1: *the
problems are reachable, merely harder.*

**It should not be reported as "t8 is fine."** The gap is 15 percentage points in
the direction predicted before the draws existed, and the test is underpowered —
44 cells against 190. A p of 0.071 is a failure to establish, not evidence of
absence. The pre-registered rule is followed because it was pre-registered, not
because the number settles the question.

## Descriptive: t8 is genuinely harder, and it is not single-draw noise

Not pre-registered, no p-values. The greedy rate of a tranche rests on **one
draw per cell**; this is the same question asked with eight times the data.

| tranche | cells | greedy | sampled (8 draws) | pinned-fail | responsive |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| t4 | 40 | 45.0% | 43.8% | 15.0% | 77.5% |
| t5 | 56 | 32.1% | 26.3% | 33.9% | 66.1% |
| t6 | 48 | 50.0% | 35.7% | 29.2% | 66.7% |
| t7 | 46 | 43.5% | 31.8% | 32.6% | 58.7% |
| **t8** | 44 | **22.7%** | **19.3%** | **43.2%** | 56.8% |
| t9 | 36 | 38.9% | 26.4% | 27.8% | 72.2% |
| **ALL** | **270** | **38.5%** | **30.4%** | 30.7% | 65.9% |

t8 stays the lowest tranche under sampling — 19.3% against 33.7% for the t4–7
pool — and it carries both the highest pinned-fail share and the lowest
responsive share. **The 22.7% was not a fluke of one unlucky draw per cell.** The
thinning mechanism logged a tranche early is doing something real to difficulty.

What the numbers do *not* support is the stronger worry that motivated the run:
that t8's problems are dead cells. **56.8% of them are responsive.** They are
harder material, not absent instrument, and they earn their place in the 400.

## The knife edge — and why a greedy tranche rate is a shakier statistic than it looks

Sampled pass count per cell, over 270 cells:

| 0/8 | 1/8 | 2/8 | 3/8 | 4/8 | 5/8 | 6/8 | 7/8 | 8/8 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 89 | 45 | 26 | 19 | 26 | 22 | 22 | 12 | 9 |

**172 cells (63.7%) sit strictly between 0/8 and 8/8.** For most of the bench, a
cell's verdict is a coin weighted somewhere in the middle, and the greedy sweep
observes one arbitrary point on it.

This does **not** make the greedy instrument unreliable — greedy is
deterministic, it reproduced 269 of 270 cells, and a greedy paired contrast
therefore carries essentially no draw noise. Reproducibility is intact. What the
spread says is something different: the cells are **sensitive**, and a lever does
not need to be large to tip a lot of them.

The pooled sampled rate is **30.4% against 38.5% greedy**. Both operating points
exist in production — `runner.py` defaults to `temperature = 0.0`, which is what
the band is aimed at and what the brief pre-registered, while the breadth path
(#119, ADR-0008) dispatches draws at temperature. So the band sits mid-aim on
the default path and at the very floor of 30–50% on the breadth path. Nothing
here re-aims anything; it means the band's position is a property of the
operating point as well as the material, which no record has said before.

## The sizing consequence, and it runs the opposite way to intuition

Higher `psi` is **not** better. D5's own table makes this explicit — reaching a
3pp bar costs 920 tasks at `psi` = 0.10 and 3,113 at `psi` = 0.35 — because more
discordant pairs means more variance in the net, and the net is what the test
reads. Feeding the measured figure back through the same function:

| n | unit | MDE at `psi_draw` = 0.659 |
|---:|---|---:|
| 270 | cells today | 14.4pp |
| 400 | problems | **11.8pp** |
| 800 | cells, at 400 problems | **8.2pp** |

D5 planned n = 400 to resolve **+5 to +8pp**. On the generous reading of the
denominator it lands at 8.2pp, the pessimistic end of that range; on the strict
reading, 11.8pp — outside it.

**This is a flag, not a finding, and the reason is in the pre-registration.**
`psi_draw` is sensitivity to *resampling*, not to a *lever*, and the two are
different quantities. A greedy lever contrast has no resampling in it at all.
High draw-sensitivity makes high lever-sensitivity plausible — a knife-edge cell
is an easy cell to tip — but plausible is not measured. **The real `psi` is still
#231's to measure on the commissioning contrast, and nothing here discharges
that.** What this run does is remove the assumption that `psi` for this material
sits in the 0.10–0.35 planning prior; there is now a reason to think it may sit
above it, and above it is the expensive direction.

## The denominator — settled 2026-08-12

D5 says 400 and the campaign counts problems. The sweep dispatches cells, and a
problem carries two language arms, so the same `psi` gives 11.8pp or 8.2pp
depending on which is meant — a factor that decides whether the bench meets its
own spec. ADR-0021 exists because D5 *"stated the number without stating its
denominator"* one level up; the same defect survived one level down.

> **DECIDED (2026-08-12, owner).** The 400 is 400 problems **each contributing
> both arms — 800 paired cells**, and that is the denominator every sizing
> figure is computed against. Recorded as an amendment to ADR-0021.

**This substantially answers the alarm above.** At 800 cells the completed bench
resolves **8.2pp**, which sits at the edge of D5's planned +5 to +8pp rather than
outside it. What remains open is not the bench's size but the real per-lever
`psi`, and that was never this run's to give.

## What this decides

1. **The catastrophic case is ruled out.** `f1` is a live instrument. Authoring
   does not stop, and no re-aim is triggered.
2. **The pre-registered rule fires outcome 1: carry on unchanged.** The owner's
   lean — accept the deviation, the 1.5B is the hard one — is the course the
   evidence supports, with the correction that t8's problems are harder in a way
   that reproduces, so the drift is material rather than noise. The band absorbs
   it; the pooled read stays in aim.
3. **160 problems remain**, and the brief stands unchanged.

## What is open — and the sequence that answers it

The denominator is settled above. One question remains: **what the real
per-lever `psi` is.** `psi_draw` = 0.659 is resampling sensitivity, and the
contrasts that matter run greedy, which is deterministic and carries no
resampling in it at all. So there is no established resolution problem — only a
removed assumption, namely that this material's `psi` sits inside D5's
0.10–0.35 planning prior.

> **DIRECTION (2026-08-12, owner).** Buy nothing yet. **#231 first, draws
> second, material last.**

1. **#231 measures `psi` on the commissioning contrast.** It is already scoped
   to do exactly this, and it is the only thing that can turn the flag into a
   number. Spending before it reports is paying for an unconfirmed problem.
2. **If it comes back high, buy draws rather than problems.** Rig time is the
   spare axis — this run cost 65 minutes for 8× — while 160 problems of
   authoring is the expensive one. Replication also converts a cell from
   pass/fail into a graded count, which is how the scaffold ablation recovered a
   question that was unanswerable at one draw per cell: *"with one greedy draw
   per cell, 25 of 34 problems"* were concordant and carried nothing. The 63.7%
   of cells sitting strictly between 0/8 and 8/8 are precisely the ones a graded
   score rescues and a binary verdict discards.
3. **A coarser bar is not on the table.** Owner direction of 2026-08-09 was to
   implement or properly rule out every means of improving the floor *"even for
   a smaller gain than 3pp"*, and D6 already carries sub-resolution effects
   through the all-on cell rather than by relaxing the bar.
