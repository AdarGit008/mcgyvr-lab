"""#167 — is mcgyvr's high c0 its output rule, or the contracts it was ported to?

The Python arm run through mcgyvr's rig is flat, and it is flat at a baseline
that already sits where the *bundle* got to: c0 scores 13/20 at 111.8
completion tokens where the original harness's c0 scores 7/20 at 427.4. The
reading is that mcgyvr's user-message assembly ends with an output rule —
"Reply with the complete new content of solution.py, as one fenced code block
and nothing else" — and that is the device  measured the bundle working
through, so the bundle arrives with nothing left to do.

There is an obvious competing explanation and it is not flattering: the mcgyvr
contracts were written by hand for this port, and a rewrite can make tasks
easier without anyone meaning it to. Arm A's per-task pattern already argues
against a wholesale effect — six tasks never pass in every arm, and arm A's set
differs from the other two by one swap in each direction — but "roughly cancels"
is not the same as "is not there".

This probe removes the rewrite from the question. It runs the **recovered**
tasks through the **recovered** harness at c0, changing exactly one thing: the
mcgyvr output rule is appended to the contract text, in the user message, where
mcgyvr puts it. Nothing else moves — same twenty contracts local-ai wrote, same
extractor, same acceptance, same endpoint.

If completion tokens collapse and the rate rises, the output rule is doing the
work and the port is not. If they do not move, arm A's baseline is an artefact
of how these contracts were written and the finding does not stand.

The vendored files are imported, never edited: the task dicts are copied and the
copies are what get the extra sentence.
