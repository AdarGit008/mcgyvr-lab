"""#167 — the four readings of the bundle ladder, laid side by side.

 measured the JS/TS bundle flat and had to scope the finding, because
the data could not say which of two things it was about:

* **Language** — the bundle device works in Python and not in JS/TS.
* **Serving stack** — the device does not work *here*. #167 drove the
  Q4_K_M blob through bare ``llama-server``; the JS/TS sweep drove the same
  blob through Ollama's OpenAI-compatible path.

They have opposite consequences, so the difference is worth an arm. This tool
does no measuring; it reads rows that already exist and prints the comparison
the measurement record is written from. Four row sets, and the pairs between
them are what separate the readings:

======================  ==========  =========  ===============  =============
row set                 task set    stack      harness          isolates
======================  ==========  =========  ===============  =============
``pybundle``             Python      llama.cpp  local-ai         #167 control
``original``            Python      Ollama     local-ai         **stack**
``rig``                 Python      Ollama     mcgyvr           **harness**
``jsts``                JS/TS       Ollama     mcgyvr           **language**
======================  ==========  =========  ===============  =============

Each row down that table changes exactly one thing from the row above it, which
is the only reason a difference between two of them can be attributed to
anything. ``pybundle`` → ``original`` is the control #167 was opened for.

All four use the columns, so one loader reads them all.
