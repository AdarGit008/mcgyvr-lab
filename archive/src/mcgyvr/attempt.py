"""Repeated attempts on one rung, each told what the one before it got wrong.

Both ends of this already existed and only the middle was missing.
:class:`~mcgyvr.escalate.RetryNotes` decides what a note may carry and excludes
three things by name; :func:`~mcgyvr.worker.prompt.build_prompt` renders a note
into the user message when it is handed one. What nothing did was take a
rejected attempt, read the note :func:`~mcgyvr.escalate.judge` had already put
on it, and hand that note to the next attempt — so ``build_prompt``'s ``retry``
parameter had no production caller and ``Judgement.retry`` was populated and
read by nobody.

That gap is not cosmetic. Without it a second attempt re-sends the identical
prompt to the identical model at temperature 0.0, which is a second sample of a
deterministic function: spend whose result is known before it is paid for. The
default of one attempt per rung is the only reason it has not cost anything yet.

**The note is not built here.** ``judge`` already produces the right one for
both rejecting paths — ``RetryNotes.of(gate)`` for a gate rejection, and the
reviewer's own words for a refusal, where the gate passed and the refusal is
therefore the whole of what failed. Rebuilding either here would be a second
place for the exclusions to be got wrong, so this module only carries what it
is given.

**A failed attempt with nothing to say ends the loop.** ``reviewer_failed`` is
the case that matters: the verifier broke, the worker did not, and the next
prompt would be byte-identical to the one that just ran. Retrying it spends a
rung's budget to re-run a deterministic function, which is the same waste this
module exists to remove — so an attempt that produces no note is treated as the
end of what this rung can learn.
