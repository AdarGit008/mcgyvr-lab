"""The sandbox interface both modes implement, and everything they share.

Two modes exist — a container (:mod:`mcgyvr.sandbox.docker`) and a temp
directory (:mod:`mcgyvr.sandbox.tempdir`) — and #30 requires that nothing
above them cares which is in use and that they share their test suite rather
than having two. So the seam between them is kept as small as it can be:

**everything except where a command runs lives here.** The workspace is a
throwaway directory with a fresh git repository, populated from the target
repository and committed once as the *base*. The gate judges the worker's
change as a real diff against that base, and :meth:`Sandbox.reset` restores
it between attempts. That workspace, its git repository, and its teardown are
identical in both modes; only :meth:`Sandbox.run` differs — on the host for a
temp directory, inside a container for Docker.

Two invariants are enforced here rather than trusted to each mode:

1. **Nothing survives a finished task.** The workspace is removed on success,
   on failure and on interrupt, by a context manager whose ``__exit__`` runs
   even when the body raises ``KeyboardInterrupt`` — and, as a backstop for
   an interpreter exit with a sandbox still open, by an ``atexit`` reaper that
   reaps whatever is still registered. The reaper does not run on
   ``os._exit``, a fatal signal or an interpreter crash.
2. **No credential reaches a task.** The environment a command runs in is
   built from an explicit allowlist, never inherited from the host, and any
   caller-supplied variable whose name looks like a credential is dropped
   before it can enter. ``SECURITY.md`` makes this a red-failing invariant,
   so :func:`credential_env_names` is the check a test asserts against.
