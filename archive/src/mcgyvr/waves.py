"""Running a plan in the order its own contracts state, and re-planning failure.

:func:`~mcgyvr.orchestrator.decompose.decompose` emits contracts and stops. A
set of contracts is a plan, but a plan nothing orders is a list: the order they
arrive in is the order a model thought of them, not a topological sort, so a
multi-step change handed straight to a runner writes against files the step
before it never created.

This module adds no judgement — which work to do is the decomposer's, whether a
change is acceptable is the gate's, which rung to spend is
:mod:`mcgyvr.route`'s. It makes three decisions, and every one of them is about
spend rather than about code:

*Order.* A wave is the pending contracts whose ``depends_on`` have all landed.
The dependency is read off the contract, because that is the only place it is
stated (:mod:`mcgyvr.contract`) and because ordering that is not written down
is ordering that does not exist.

*Refusal.* A contract whose dependency did not land is **not attempted**, and
that is a different outcome from attempting it and failing. Its input was never
written, so the attempt could only produce a rejection — one that costs a
rung's tokens, and that then reads in every record downstream as the worker's
fault rather than as the plan's. The plan was wrong; the record should say so.

*Re-planning.* A failed wave is re-planned, not retried. The re-planner is told
which contracts failed and why, because one told only that "something failed"
re-emits the step that just failed; and what it returns replaces those
contracts rather than joining them, because a wave loop that ran the same
contract again would be a retry loop wearing a plan's clothes. Retrying one
contract on one rung is ``limits.attempts``; carrying it to a dearer rung is
:mod:`mcgyvr.escalate`. Both already exist, and this is neither.

Nothing here touches a repository, a model or the clock. ``attempt`` is an
unbound parameter, the way every expensive step in mcgyvr already is, so a plan
can be driven end to end with no rung configured at all — which is what makes
the ordering above a property of this module rather than of whatever eventually
binds it.

nothing, so a correct plan of any depth runs to completion — the chain is

the budget is spent is reported by name, never retried quietly.

    own truth value. One that did not land is asked for a ``reason``.
    Deliberately no narrower than that — the outcome of a real dispatch belongs
    to whatever binds this parameter, and a driver that demanded that type would
    be unusable until it existed.

    Reading a stated verdict first is what makes that width real rather than
    nominal, because **not one terminal outcome in mcgyvr defines** ``__bool__``.
    That is on purpose and it is the codebase's policy: a caller is meant to
    match on the answer rather than remember a boolean's polarity. Every one of
