"""The pending store (D23) — gate-passed work that could not be verified, kept.

A task can reach the last step and fail to take it: the verifier is unreachable,
the key is missing, the API is down. Everything upstream of that moment was real
— the tokens were spent, the gate passed, the file is right — and mcgyvr persists
none of it. The next run starts from the unchanged tree and buys the same answer
again, and nobody can see that this happened.

So this is **working state, not history**. X02's telemetry records what was
attempted; this records what is still *owed*, which is a different question: a
record of a stranded attempt does not let you finish it. What makes an entry
finishable is what it carries — the exact bytes the gate saw, and the contract
that defined the gate — and four properties this module exists to hold:

* **The bytes are the bytes.** Stored and restored through
  ``bytes``/``surrogateescape``, never through a text round-trip that could strip
  a trailing space, re-encode, or add a final newline. Re-verifying bytes nobody
  gated is worse than not stashing at all: the verdict would be about a file that
  never existed. The contract is stored as :func:`mcgyvr.contract.dumps` JSON,
  which is the emitted form the loader round-trips — an entry that cannot be
  re-loaded into a contract is not resumable, and it is better to find that out
  when stashing than when recovering.
* **Resuming re-runs the gate.** :func:`resume` restores the bytes and hands the
  whole apply-check-commit decision to :func:`mcgyvr.deliver.deliver`, which
  judges them again against the tree they are landing in. The earlier gate pass
  belonged to different bytes and to a tree that has since moved; a verifier
  approving today does not make yesterday's tree true. This was the claim the
  module made and the code did not: ``resume`` handed over a bare ``str``, which
  delivery took as an acceptance, so a stub verifier was enough to commit bytes
  the gate had rejected. Delivery reaches its own verdict now, and what the store
  contributes is the half delivery cannot reach — the verdict from the sandboxed
  rungs, and the identity of the bytes it was reached on.
* **The verdict is stored with the bytes, or not at all.** :func:`stash` takes an
  :class:`mcgyvr.deliver.Accepted` from the caller that gated, records its digest
  and its verdict in ``meta.json``, and :func:`resume` rebuilds the pair from the
  entry. That is the one place ``Accepted.intact`` can come out false and mean
  something: the digest was minted in the workspace the gate ran in, the bytes
  come back off a directory anybody with a shell can edit, and a mismatch says
  the work that is about to be committed is not the work that was judged.
* **A failed recovery changes nothing.** The entry is removed only after a commit
  exists. Clearing on the way out is one line and it sits on the path nobody
  exercises, which is exactly how a store like this leaks: an outage lasting
  through one recovery run would destroy the work the store exists to protect.
* **One task, one entry.** A newer attempt replaces the older entry wholesale
  rather than sitting beside it, because two stashes for one task means a later
  resume picks its bytes by directory order.

The layout under ``<store>/<slug>/`` is deliberately readable by a person with
``cat``, since the operator reading it is usually mid-incident: ``contract.json``
(what defined the gate), ``files/<target>`` (the exact bytes), ``change.patch``
(what a reviewer or a verifier prompt wants to see), and ``meta.json`` (what is
owed, and when it was stranded). ``meta.json`` is written **last** and is what
:func:`listing` keys on, so a stash interrupted halfway is invisible rather than
half-resumable, and the new entry is built beside the old one and renamed over
it, so nothing is lost in the window between them.
