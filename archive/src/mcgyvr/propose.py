"""Turn detected hardware into a proposed ladder.

The capability table says what models are worth running and what they cost
(``mcgyvr.capability``); detection says what this machine has. This module
is the join: which rungs to bind, in what order, and why each one was
chosen. It reads no hardware and touches no network — everything it needs
arrives as arguments, which is what keeps it testable against machines
nobody here owns.

**The ladder must not invert.** A higher rung has to be measurably better
than the one below, or it is not a rung. This is not a style preference:
escalation spends the cheap rung's tokens *and* the expensive rung's, so a
rung that is bigger but no better makes escalation actively harmful — it
costs strictly more than starting higher would have. The table's
``deepseek-coder-v2:16b`` is the worked example: 9.4 GB for 72.6%, against
``qwen2.5-coder:7b``'s 5.0 GB for 84.1%. Nearly twice the VRAM, meaningfully
worse. A ladder built on size would place it above the 7B and be wrong.

Three stages produce the gradient, and their order matters:

1. **Collapse equal-quality ties.** Two models estimated at the same score
   are one rung. The faster one wins, because once both fit the card, latency is
   what the user experiences and footprint only buys concurrency headroom.
   This runs FIRST: doing it after dominance lets a model be eliminated by a
   candidate that is itself dropped a step later.
2. **Dominance.** Drop any model another candidate beats on quality while
   fitting in the same VRAM or less. This is what removes the deepseek case.
   It is decided per machine, since eligibility depends on which backends are
   actually reachable.
3. **Measurable separation.** Keep a lower rung only if it is at least
   ``MIN_QUALITY_GAIN`` below the rung above. Rungs closer than that are
   within measurement resolution, so escalating between them buys latency
   variance rather than capability.

The ceiling — the best model that fits — is always kept; lower rungs are
added beneath it. Selecting the other way round would let the ceiling be
dropped for sitting too close to a cheaper rung, which is exactly backwards.

Note that dominance deliberately does *not* rank on speed. deepseek-coder-v2
is the fastest model in the table at 110 tok/s, and treating throughput as a
dimension a model can win on would rescue the one model the gradient rule
exists to exclude. Speed breaks ties between equals; it never buys a rung.

Models with no quality estimate are never proposed. That is enforced upstream in
``CapabilityTable.fitting``, and the rejection is surfaced here by name so a
user can see that a model they expected was withheld on purpose rather than
overlooked.

    * **A backend on another machine reports holding it.** The local card is

    The second ground is deliberately the weaker claim and is labelled as

    different things to different backends — vLLM lists what it has loaded,
