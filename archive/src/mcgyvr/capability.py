"""Reader for the shipped capability table, and the one question a task asks it.

The table (``data/capability-table.json``) is estimates by card class, not
readings of the user's machine. ``mcgyvr capabilities`` lists it, and
``mcgyvr emit`` sizes a unit from the row whose id equals the unit's model,
unless a unit in fleet.yaml declares that model, for example under ``launch``
or as ``room_mib``. ``mcgyvr init`` does not read it: init binds the models running
servers list (:mod:`mcgyvr.propose`). See ``data/README.md`` for what a card
class is and for the harness caveats that make some published numbers unusable.

Reading and validating is most of this module.

**What one number can and cannot decide.** Every row carries a single quality
figure — an estimated HumanEval+ pass@1 — and one number induces a total order, so
the only question a scalar can answer is *which model is better*. That is the
wrong question to put to a contract. Producing a loop invariant that holds and
producing prose about a loop nobody may touch are not two points on one line,
and ranking them on one line sends an implementation contract to whichever model
scored higher on a benchmark that is mostly short functions.

So a row may also carry a ``capabilities`` vector: a score per
*dimension*, and :func:`select_for_task` filters on the dimension the task
actually needs instead of on the scalar. Two properties keep that from being a
regression on the day it lands:

* **An absent vector is unscored, not unfit.** No shipped row has one yet, so a
  filter reading "no data" as "fails the floor" would empty the pool on every
  install. :meth:`Model.capability` falls back to the scalar, which is the half
  of this that is easiest to drop and most expensive to have dropped.
* **A model with no valid quality at all is still never proposed.** The table
  keeps invalidated readings aside rather than filling the gap with a figure
  from elsewhere (``data/README.md``), and the fallback inherits that: a model
  with no quality estimate stays without one, and there is nothing to fall
  back *to*.

    needs — its vector entry if it has one, its scalar quality if it does not,
    and nothing at all if it has no estimate. Then the *choice*: among models that
    clear the gate, the smallest working footprint wins, because above the floor
    a model is good enough and more VRAM buys nothing the contract asked for.
    That is the ladder's own economics — cheapest rung that can do the job —

    Ties break on the dimension score and then on the id, so the same table and

    a comparison between two runs unreadable.
