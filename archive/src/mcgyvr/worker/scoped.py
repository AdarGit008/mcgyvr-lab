"""A change scoped to one definition edits one definition, and nothing else.

The reply protocol next door is whole-file and only whole-file: one fenced
block becomes the whole of a file. That is the right default — it is the only
shape that needs no patch algebra and cannot half-apply — and it is a poor fit
for the common case. A contract that names one function has just asked a small
model to re-emit every other line of the file *correctly*, and every one of
those lines is a chance to drop a decorator, a helper or an import. The worker
is charged output tokens for bytes nobody wanted changed, and the gate can only
tell you afterwards that something else moved.

So a scoped edit asks for the one definition and splices it back. The rules the
splice is built on:

**The bytes outside the named node are the bytes that were there before.**
Not "equivalent", not "reformatted the same way" — the head and the tail are
carried across as the strings they already were, and only the node's own line
span is replaced. That is what makes "nothing else changed" a property of this
function rather than a hope about the worker's output, and it is why the splice
is by line span rather than by unparsing the tree: :func:`ast.unparse` would
rewrite the entire file into its own idea of Python and lose every comment in
it.

**The node is found by AST, not by pattern.** ``def fetch`` appears in a
docstring, in a string literal and in a comment, and a regex that finds the
wrong one writes into the middle of something. The parser knows which
occurrence is a definition and where it ends, including a body that dedents to
column zero inside a triple-quoted string.

**A decorator belongs to what it decorates.** A definition's ``lineno`` is its
``def`` line, so decorators above it are outside the replaced span and survive —
which is what a worker that re-emitted only the function needs. A worker that
*did* re-emit the decorators is the other half: the span then starts at the
existing node's first decorator, because otherwise the file ends up with the
decorator twice and the second one applies to nothing anybody wrote.

**A node the file does not have is appended, never substituted.** Finding no
match and writing the fragment over the file deletes the file; finding no match
and refusing throws away work that was done correctly. Appending is the only
outcome that loses neither. It goes on at module level with the two blank lines
a formatter would put there — and with the file's own line ending, not ``\\n``,
so a scoped addition does not fail the gate's style check on whitespace it never
chose, nor arrive as a whole-file reformat because half the file now ends its
lines differently from the other half.

**Only module-level definitions are spliced.** The worker's fragment comes back
at column zero; writing it over a method's line span would put a dedented body
inside a class. A scope that names something the file has only as a nested
definition is refused by name rather than mis-spliced, and dotted scopes
(``Class.method``) are not part of this port.

**A refusal is returned, not raised.** local-ai's ``merge_back`` raises
``ApplyError``; here the caller is the same one that already distinguishes a
parsed file from a :class:`~mcgyvr.worker.reply.ReplyError`, and a scoped merge
that cannot proceed has exactly the routing consequence a refused reply has —
one attempt spent, a reason to say. Two vocabularies for that would be two
things for a caller to get right.

Ported from local-ai's ``mvp/orchestrator/apply.py`` (``merge_back``,
``archive/docs/port-from-local-ai.md``, D14).
