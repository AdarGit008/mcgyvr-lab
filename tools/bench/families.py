"""Which problems are the same problem, decided by execution rather than wording.

Issue: `#268 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/268>`_.

The admission gate screens candidates on task-prose overlap
(``tools/problems/admit.py``, ``JACCARD_REJECT = 0.55``). That screen tests
*wording*, and the corpus proves it insufficient: ``b094-relay-chain`` and
``b172-trace-relay`` specify one computation — walk a name-to-name chain from
``start`` until the empty string, return the names visited — under two stories,
a courier relay and a harbour night watch. Their prose Jaccard is **0.27**, half
the reject threshold.

**The method.** Write A's ``reference`` as the solution, alias A's functions to
the names B's acceptance imports, and run B's acceptance. If it passes, A's
behaviour satisfies every requirement B states. Run both directions:

===================  ==========================================================
both directions      the two are behaviourally interchangeable — a duplicate
one direction        the passing side is a *superset*: same core, more required
neither              distinct, as far as either acceptance can tell
===================  ==========================================================

Deterministic, no model, no rig time.

**What it cannot see, and this is not a footnote.** Two problems that differ
only in a *constant* fail each other's tests and read as distinct. That is
exactly the duplicate this project has already removed: ``b080-brace-fill``,
``b090-expand-markers`` and ``b168-badge-slots`` were one problem three times,
differing only in ``{name}`` / ``%name%`` / ``<name>``
(``tools/bench/retired.json``). Replayed here, ``b080``'s reference fails
``b168``'s first substantive assertion. **``emit.py``'s sibling screen catches
those and this does not; this catches ``b094``/``b172`` and the prose screen
does not.** Neither is sufficient, and a problem that is both re-skinned *and*
re-parameterised is invisible to both.

**Containment is directed, and the prune has to be too.** A source satisfies a
target only if it supplies every function the target's acceptance imports, so
the comparable direction is the one where the target's *arity multiset* is
contained in the source's — not the one where the two are equal. Requiring
equality was this scan's own blind spot and it cost two known families:
``b333-pace-split`` declares ``pace_list/1`` and ``pace_of/2``, and
``b302-stock-take`` and ``b277-fuel-legs`` each declare one function of arity 2,
so shape equality never compared them and ``b302 ⊂ b277 ⊂ b333`` went unseen
(#268, 2026-08-17). Pairs are therefore generated as directed ordered pairs
under containment, which is why the run count is not twice the pair count.

Further limits, so a reader does not take "no duplicates found" for "no
duplicates": a pair differing by an *optional* parameter has different arities
and is still never compared; where a source declares several functions of one
arity, the alias picks by sorted order, so same-arity helpers may be paired in
the wrong order; references that raise different exception types for one error
read as distinct; and a timeout counts as a failure.
