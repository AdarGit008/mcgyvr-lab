"""How much of the INTERFACE section the task prose already carries.

Issue: `#266 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/266>`_, the material
survey; `#267 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/267>`_, the successor
manipulation.

``render_user_message`` (``src/mcgyvr/worker/prompt.py``) emits an ``INTERFACE``
section from every contract that states one, so an ablation that removes it is
only a manipulation to the extent the prose does not say the same thing twice.
This module measures the redundancy over the corpus, before any rig time is
spent.

**It reads contracts, never runs.** It states no pass rate and describes no
measurement, so it carries no mode declaration — the same footing as
``tools/power/mde.py``.

**What the numbers are and are not.** Literal substring presence is a *lower*
bound on what a model can recover: prose that says "return those words in order"
conveys ``string[]`` without containing it. So a high literal figure is strong
evidence of redundancy, and a low one is weak evidence of its absence. Only the
*name* result (99.2%) is strong enough to carry a conclusion on its own.

    It does not, on either arm:

    * ``bench-py`` — Python annotations are inert at runtime. ``accept.py``
      imports the symbol and calls it; a wrong annotation changes nothing about
      whether the assertions hold.
    * ``bench-ts`` — no ``tsconfig.json`` is staged and the repository has none,
      so ``tsc --noEmit`` never runs (#262). No rung reads a type.

    **This is not an argument that the type half of INTERFACE is inert, and it
    was misused as one on 2026-08-14.** The two are different directions through
    the pipeline. The annotation is an *output*, and an unscored one. The type in
    ``INTERFACE`` is an *input*, and it steers the *shape of the value returned*
    — which the assertions do score. ``b244-seat-block`` is the standing case:
    ``-> list`` against prose reading "return the row as a number and the letter
    separately, in that order", where a tuple satisfies the prose and fails the
    test.

    So of the three things ``INTERFACE`` states, only the *name* is measurably
    redundant (99.2%). The return shape is carried literally on 28.8% of
    contracts, and how much of the remaining 71.2% the prose conveys informally
    is not settled by this module.

    Stated as a function rather than a comment so a future staged type checker
    makes it return ``True`` and the argument has to be re-made.
