"""What the bench can resolve, per stratum, and never pooled.

Doctrine: the null is measured per target tier and does not transfer up the
ladder, and *a report refuses a pooled figure across a stratum where the effect
is heterogeneous, and reports per stratum instead*.

``tools/power/mde.py`` holds the arithmetic. This module supplies it the two
things it needs from a real contrast — the eligible cell count and the measured
discordance rate ``psi`` — **per stratum**, and prints what each can and cannot
resolve.

**Why there is no pooled row, and why that is not a formatting choice.** Two
separate objections, either sufficient:

1. **Across arms.** ``bench-py`` and ``bench-ts`` are not a language contrast.
   They are two bars — a ruff selection and an eslint one that resolve to
   different rule sets (``bar_resolved`` in ``run.json``), and no type check on
   either. A figure pooled over them describes neither instrument.
2. **Within an arm.** Measured over the committed ``norule`` contrasts, ``psi``
   ranges **0.029 to 0.134 across task types inside a single arm** — a 4.6x
   spread. That is heterogeneity no figure may pool over, and the pooled number
   is readable only because a dead stratum averaged with a live one lands
   somewhere plausible.

The arm-level row is printed because a reader will otherwise compute it, and it
is marked so it cannot be quoted as the bench's resolution.

**``psi`` belongs to the pair, not to the task set.** It is a property of
(instrument, lever): the rate at which *this* lever flips *this* material. A
resolution computed from ``norule`` describes what a ``norule``-sized
manipulation can be read at, and a new arm computes its own. There is no single
number for "the bench".

**What this module does not check.** It keys on the ``--tier`` label and the
arm and does not call ``identity.require_comparable``; two runs agreeing on both
labels and differing in the bar are laid side by side here without complaint.
