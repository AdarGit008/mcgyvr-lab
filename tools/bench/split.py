"""#225 — the bench/reserve split rule, committed before anything was read.

One function decides which half of the campaign an admitted problem belongs
to, from its id alone. The rule was declared in
``mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/bench-design-2026-08-10.md`` and committed here before
any generated problem existed — that ordering, not the hash, is what makes the
split blind: no prose, no difficulty figure, no measurement can move a problem
across the line, and nothing that arrives later can have been fitted to it.

Properties the campaign leans on:

* **Stable under pauses.** Assignment depends only on the id string, so a
  spend-limit pause, a refill batch, or a retired id changes nothing already
  assigned (#197's record makes pauses a certainty).
* **A problem moves as a unit.** The id names the problem; both language
  arms travel with it. A one-armed problem is never split — it is deleted.
* **Representative in expectation, reported rather than repaired.** Each
  steering cell splits ~50/50 with binomial noise; the gate reports realized
  counts per cell, and a skewed cell is recorded and lived with, because
  rebalancing after the fact is exactly the fitting this rule exists to
  prevent.

``python tools/bench/split.py b001-ring-buffer …`` prints one ``id<TAB>half``
line per argument; ``--check`` verifies a stream of ``id half`` pairs on
stdin (the manifest audit's seam).
