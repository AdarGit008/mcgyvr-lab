"""Which cells a lever can act on, and whether that set has room to move.

Issue: `#266 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/266>`_.

A lever's eligible set is decided by the contract, not by the run: ``noscaffold``
and ``planonly`` both write ``target_content``, so a task carrying none is a
no-op by construction and contributes a concordant pair. ``matrix.json`` states
that rule; this module counts it.

**Eligibility is the cheap half.** The half that decides whether a contrast can
be read is *headroom*: a cell that passes under no condition cannot produce a
discordant pair whatever the lever does, so the count of eligible cells is an
upper bound on ``m`` only if those cells can pass at all. That is the rule
this module exists to apply — *"a stratum with no headroom is
excluded, not reported as null. 'No effect where nothing passes' is absent
resolution, not absent effect."* — and the ``m >= 6`` wall is what the
answer is measured against.

Both numbers are computed from the corpus and the committed runs rather than
stated, because #243's record is four cases of a quoted figure surviving until
someone re-derived it by hand.
