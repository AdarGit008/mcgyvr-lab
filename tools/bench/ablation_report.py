"""#225 — reading the scaffold ablation: two knobs, paired, per language.

The question is what makes a bench problem hard for a floor model. It was
first asked as two separately authored cohorts and could not be answered:
unpaired comparisons spend power like independent samples, which is
the wall in a new costume (`strata.json` block 3). This reads the
paired form, where the same problem is dispatched under three renders:

* ``stock``      — the scaffold as production ships it: plan comment + partial code
* ``planonly``   — the scaffold's comments only; the code removed
* ``noscaffold`` — no scaffold at all

which splits one confounded contrast into two clean ones:

* **code**      ``stock`` vs ``planonly``   — what the partial code was worth,
  with the plan held constant in both arms
* **plan**      ``planonly`` vs ``noscaffold`` — what being told the approach was
  worth, with the whole file to write in both arms
* **whole**     ``stock`` vs ``noscaffold`` — both together; the contrast that
  would have been reported as a size effect had the plan not been noticed

**Why pass counts rather than pass/fail.** A problem that fails every draw
under both conditions is concordant and carries no information no matter how
the test is designed; with one greedy draw per cell, 25 of 34 problems were
that. Eight draws per cell turn the outcome into a count, so a problem that
moves from 6/8 to 2/8 contributes what a binary outcome would have thrown
away. Replication is the only reason the question is askable on this material
at all.

**The tests are exact and the direction is not assumed.** The sign test over
problems whose count changed is reported as the primary, because it needs no
distributional assumption and its p-value is honest at the sample sizes here.
Wilcoxon signed-rank is reported beside it (exact by enumeration when the
number of non-zero differences allows) because it uses the size of each
change, not only its direction. ``m`` — the count of problems that moved — is
printed for every contrast, because the wall is stated in exactly that
quantity: below m = 6 no result can reach significance however large the
effect looks.

**The analysis set was fixed before any of these numbers existed**, and it
lives in ``ablation-sets.json`` rather than in whoever ran the command. Seven
of the 34 dispatched problems have task prose that says the helper "is already
written", so ablating them yields a prompt contradicting itself — those are
excluded, not because of what they showed but because of what the prompt says.
Four more the eligibility audit flagged as carrying information the prose does
not are dropped in ``--set strict``, reported alongside so that a conclusion
resting on them is visible as such.

This is not a formality. Read over all 34 the 7B whole-scaffold contrast is
significant on both arms; read over the pre-registered 27 it is not, and the
difference is the seven self-contradicting prompts. The default here is the
pre-registered set for that reason, and ``--set dispatched`` is available for
anyone who wants the other number with its name attached.

**Two sets of verdicts exist for these rows, and the reader names which it
used.** ``--rows as-measured`` (the default) reads what the sweep recorded on
the day. ``--rows regraded`` reads ``tools/bench/regrade.py``'s re-score of the
same saved completions under the checkers as they stand now — the same model
output judged again. A corrected checker moves cells: py checkers accepting
only ``ValueError`` where their ts twins accept any ``Error`` is the case
``regrade.py`` exists for. Both sets are real and they answer different
questions, so neither is silently preferred and the heading always says which
one is on screen.
