"""Where a run's intent lives, and the date its shape stops being provisional.

The repo records what a run **was** — `run.json`, and `identity.KEY`, the
fields held by `identity.require_comparable`. A header records what a run is
**for**: the question, what else it could have carried, what was left on the
table. A header is declared before the run starts, and a gate that checks one
**records rather than refuses**, so the register emerges from real headers.

This module is the half that is not the gate: the record type, the home, the
listing, and the review point. The gate — a driver that writes or checks a
header before a run starts — stays in #322 and writes this record type.

**Four properties, each one a rule below.**

1. *The closing condition is declared now.* :data:`REVIEW_AFTER` is 10, #322's
   own number ("before we have seen ten of the things it has to describe").
   When ten headers carrying a ``run`` block exist and no ``run-header/2``
   schema is on disk, ``list`` exits non-zero and says the review is owed. The
   owed state is code, not memory: nobody has to remember to look.
2. *A machine-readable spine, prose underneath.* :data:`KEYS` is closed — a key
   it does not name is refused — and free text goes under ``notes``. Open
   questions dispersed over 147 session records is what that rule is for.
3. *``unknown`` is a value and carries provenance.* An agent asked for a number
   it cannot source will invent one. ``{"unknown": true, "searched": [...]}``
   with a non-empty list is the way to say "I looked"; the bare string
   ``"unknown"`` and a bare ``{"unknown": true}`` are refused. A field nobody
   can fill is a gap discovered as a side effect of trying to fill it, which is
   the mechanism, not the fallback.
4. *A greppable home outside the dated evidence directory.* Questions kept in
   ``records/evidence/<date>/`` die with their campaign. They live in
   ``records/headers/<date>-<slug>.json`` instead, where ``<date>`` is the
   run's start date when there is a run and the declared date when there is
   not — so a question filed today and answered by a run next month keeps the
   date it was asked.

v1 requires four fields. Everything else is optional **on purpose**: which
fields become required is the review's decision, and requiring them now would
be inventing the shape before seeing the things it has to describe.
