"""#231 check 2 — the rule-ablation positive control, read to its pre-registration.

The pre-registration is
``mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/archive/sessions/lane/231/2026-08-13-positive-control-prereg.md``,
declared before a single ``norule`` draw. Everything decided there is applied here
rather than restated: the comparator is run **A** (run B is a sensitivity check, not
an
alternative), recovery requires **direction and the mechanism's signature**, and
``m >= 6`` or no p-value is quoted.

**Why the rung counts are recomputed rather than read off ``rejected_by``.**
``Gate.run`` short-circuits, so ``rejected_by`` is the first rung that fired —
an ordering artefact. Comparing two conditions on it would show rungs trading
places whenever a candidate fails several, which is exactly what an ablation
does. ``fail_output`` carries every finding, so the rung *sets* below are the
real profile.
