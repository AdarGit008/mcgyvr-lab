"""The condition matrix's report: one table, every cell, both outcome axes.

Issue: `#113 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/113>`_ — *"a pass-rate
report per condition, carrying n, model, rig and conditions"*, and *"the report
must carry the interaction term — combined effect minus the sum of singles"*.

A run directory holds **one cell**. This reads a set of them and lays them
beside each other, which is the only thing a condition matrix is for.

**What it refuses to do.** Three things, all because a comparison that is not
comparable is worse than no comparison:

* it will not state a rate for a cell whose manifest cannot say which model,
  which rig and which bar produced it;
* it will not lay two cells beside each other unless they agree on model, rig,
  serving build, tier and scoring rungs. A contrast between cells that differ
  in one of those varies two things and attributes the result to one.
* it will not treat two silences as agreement. A keyed field that is absent or
  ``null`` in a cell is not a match. Reading such cells is allowed and has to be
  asked for, with ``--allow-unfingerprinted``, and the fields that went
  unchecked are printed beside the numbers.

**The interaction term.** Levers are *comparable but not addable*: two that fix
the same three tasks give +3, not +6. For a cell naming more than one lever the
report prints combined-minus-the-sum-of-singles, and prints **absent** rather
than zero when a single-lever arm is missing from the run — a gap in the matrix
is not evidence that two levers are additive.

**The reproducibility bound.** Every table states the deviation two identical
runs may differ by, and a contrast at or inside it is marked as the instrument
rather than the lever. When no null has been measured for this model, at this
tier, under this bar and on this serving build, the report says **not declared**
and leaves every delta unqualified — it does not fall back to zero, to another
tier's number, or to silence. The declaration is ``reproducibility.json``; the
number that fills it is #231's.
