"""The product revision under test, pinned as a digest, and the round it belongs to.

Every arm in a round runs against one product revision; an adopted change
lands at the round boundary, never mid-flight. Without this a winning arm
silently re-baselines its own siblings and comparability — the entire point of
one bench — is lost.

**What this pins.** ``tasks_sha256`` pins the *tasks* and ``bundle_sha256`` the
system prompt (it hashes ``prompt.system`` and nothing else). Everything between
those two — the user-message render, the reply parser, the runner, and the whole
of ``Gate.run`` that decides pass or fail — is pinned by the digest here.

**Why a content digest and not the git SHA.** A commit id describes a tree, not
a working directory, and every measurement in this project is dispatched from a
working directory. ``git rev-parse HEAD`` on a dirty tree names a revision that
was not the one under test, which is worse than naming none. The digest below is
over file *contents*, so it is true of what actually ran.

**Why the surface is coarse.** The obvious alternative is a curated list of the
modules a bench dispatch touches. A guard that names a subset does not
refuse what it omits — it permits it silently, which reads as having checked. So
the surface is *the product*: every module under ``src/mcgyvr``, plus the rig
files that dispatch and score. An unrelated edit closing a round is the cost; a
missed edit corrupting a contrast is the failure it exists to prevent, and only
one of those two is recoverable.

**The bar is configuration as much as code, and both are in.** Half the bar
lives in the scorer's configuration: ``score.lint_config`` derives the workspace
ruff settings from ``pyproject.toml`` at call time, ``score.stage_js_toolchain``
copies ``eslint.config.mjs`` into every workspace, and the checkers themselves
are whatever ``uv.lock`` and ``package-lock.json`` resolve to. A rule flipped
off in either config file, or a checker moved by a lockfile bump, narrows what
the gate rejects. Both lockfiles, never one: the arms are paired ts/py, and
pinning Python's checker while JavaScript's floats puts a language effect inside
every contrast the bench will publish.

**A directory contributes every file beneath it, whatever the extension** — so
``src/mcgyvr/prompts/*.md``, the literal text a worker is sent, is inside the
digest of the thing that sends it. The only exclusion is a path derived from
files already hashed here (``__pycache__/``, ``*.pyc``): including those would
make the pin depend on whether the tree had been imported rather than on what it
contains. Everything else under a declared directory is in, including a file
authored and not yet committed — enumeration is the filesystem's and not ``git
ls-files``', because a new file dispatched before it is committed is exactly the
unpinned code this refusal exists to catch.

**What the surface deliberately excludes.** ``tools/bench/tasks/`` — the task set
is already pinned per run by ``tasks_sha256``, and folding it in here would close
a round every time a problem is authored, which is corpus work and not a product
change. ``data/task-catalog.json`` is a different thing and *is* in: it is the
vocabulary a contract is validated against, read by the product at run time, not
the set of problems. ``tests/`` — a test cannot change what a worker is sent or
how a candidate is scored. ``records/`` and ``archive/`` for the same reason. And
the read-time tools — ``report.py``, ``identity.py``, ``mode.py`` — which
describe runs already on disk and neither dispatch nor score; a change to how a
table is printed must not re-baseline the measurements it prints.

**Rounds are append-only.** ``rounds.json`` carries the whole history, newest
last, and the open round is the final entry. A round is closed by opening the
next one, which is the only place an adopted change may land; the new entry
names what was adopted. Editing a closed round's digest would retroactively
re-describe measurements already on disk, which is the failure mode this file
exists to make impossible, so ``--open`` and :func:`ensure_open` only ever
append.

**And every pending identity change lands in the same boundary.** Landing three
identity changes piecemeal, with runs between them, converts one re-baseline
into three incomparable ones — each round's arms measurable only against each
other, and the rig time spent three times. So the boundary is *drained*, not
*taken*: every adopted change waiting on a round goes in together, and
``--open`` refuses without ``--adopted``, which is where the driver names the
batch. The rule lives in ``rounds.json``'s ``doctrine`` block — data the tool
reads and prints back.

The tool **records** the batch; it cannot **verify** it. Nothing here can know
which issues are still open, and gating a judgement call on a heuristic would
teach drivers to work around the tool rather than the rule. What ``--open``
enforces is that the batch is named and the moved files are shown at the moment
the round closes, which is the one moment the rule is violable.
