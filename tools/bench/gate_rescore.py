"""#224 A2 hole 1 — re-score saved candidates under ``Gate.run``, at zero token cost.

**The hole this closes.** Every multi-draw run this project owns — the only
source of ``psi_draw`` — was scored by running the contract's acceptance command
and nothing else, because it predates #113. Its rows carry no ``rejected_by``.
``headroom`` and ``psi``, meanwhile, are gate-scored. So #224's table compares a
lenient-scorer number against a strict-scorer number and cannot say how much of
the gap is the bar rather than the observable. The candidate texts are on disk;
the bar is a pure function of them; the difference is recoverable offline.

**Why this is not** ``tools/bench/regrade.py``. That tool re-runs *acceptance
only*, by design, and its docstring says so — it exists to recover figures after
a **checker** was corrected (the ``ValueError`` asymmetry). Holding the
scorer fixed at acceptance is the property that makes its output comparable with
the runs it re-scores. This tool does the opposite: it holds the candidate fixed
and **changes the scorer**, from acceptance-only to the five rungs the product
ships. Two opposite invariants cannot live behind one flag, so they are two
tools. What is shared is composed rather than copied — ``checker_digests`` is
imported from ``regrade`` and the doctrine below is inherited whole.

**The doctrine, kept from** ``regrade.py``:

* The original ``results.jsonl`` is **never rewritten.** It records what was
  measured on the day under the scorer of the day, and a record that changes
  when the tooling changes is not a record. The re-score lands beside it.
* Rows that never reached a checker are **carried forward and marked**, not
  re-graded. A dispatch error is a draw nobody saw and a parse refusal happened
  before any checker ran; scoring either would invent an observation.
* The candidate text is **re-parsed rather than trusted**, so a row that used to
  parse and now does not is surfaced instead of silently re-graded.

**Why** ``score.score`` **is called rather than reimplemented.** It is the exact
function the live sweep runs (``score.score``, called from
``tools/breadth/measure.py``), including the staged ``pyproject.toml``, the
``.gitignore`` that keeps ``__pycache__`` out of the changeset, and the linked
``node_modules``. A re-score that scored
differently from a sweep would answer nothing — the whole point is to put
``psi_draw`` on the same bar as ``headroom``, and "the same bar" has to mean the
same code.

**Why the condition matters here and not in** ``regrade``. The scaffold ablations
are re-scored too, and under ``noscaffold`` the worker was told the target file
was empty. ``Gate.run``'s scope rung judges a *diff*, so the tree it is diffed
against must be the tree the worker was shown, or the scaffold's removal is
attributed to the worker and every ablated cell is rejected at ``scope``. The
base is therefore staged from ``breadth.ablate(contract, condition)``, exactly as
the sweep stages it. Acceptance-only scoring never looked at a diff, which is
why ``regrade`` can ignore this and this tool cannot.

**A degraded run is refused, not annotated.** The lint and format rungs shell out
to ``ruff``, ``eslint`` and ``prettier``. A missing tool is an *environment
issue* — the gate records it and does not reject the worker for it — so a
re-score with ruff absent would silently be a three-rung bar wearing a five-rung
label, and would read as "the gate was kinder than we thought". ``score.preflight``
is run first and answers the question that matters, which is not *installed* but
*able to reject*.

Usage::

    uv run --no-sync python tools/bench/gate_rescore.py <dir> [<dir> ...]
    uv run --no-sync python tools/bench/gate_rescore.py --check <dir>

``<dir>`` is a measurement directory holding ``run.json``, ``results.jsonl`` and
``candidates/`` — the same unit ``regrade.py`` takes.
