"""#225 — what the sibling screen is worth, and what the split costs.

`emit.py` refuses a draft whose reference shares >= 0.70 of an existing
problem's token skeleton, and warns from 0.55. The refusal was bought by a real
failure: `b080-brace-fill`, `b090-expand-markers` and `b168-badge-slots` were
one problem three times, two of them in the bench half, and the gate's *prose*
screen could not see it because the three delimiters share almost no vocabulary.
`b168` scores 0.74 of `b080`'s shape. The screen catches what burned us.

What was never checked is the premise underneath it: **that shape similarity
predicts measurement redundancy.** A duplicate is expensive because it occupies
two slots in the count while carrying one slot's information — under the paired
test it contributes a concordant pair, which is `n` without `m`. If two problems
that share a skeleton do *not* behave alike, the screen is defending the
statistic against nothing, and the authoring it costs is spent on an aesthetic.

The responsiveness run of 2026-08-11 makes that testable: 270 cells, nine draws
each. This tool reads it three ways.

* **saturation** — each admitted problem's nearest sibling *among those admitted
  before it*, by tranche. The trend that prompted the question.
* **redundancy** — does that similarity predict how alike two cells behave?
  Reported as a correlation over every within-arm pair, and as Fisher's exact
  test on the nearest pairs individually.
* **denominator** — what the instrument resolves, counted in cells that are
  actually swept. `split.py` sends ~half of every tranche to a reserve that
  `mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/bench-design-2026-08-10.md` states is never swept
  and no rig tier serves.

**A limit that cannot be argued around.** No admitted pair scores >= 0.70 —
they were refused before emission or retired after it. So the redundancy read is
*censored at the refusal line*, and it says nothing about what a refused twin
would have done. It bears on the 0.55 warn band, which costs an author a read
every time it fires. It is not grounds for moving the refusal.

The converse limit is worse and is the reason this tool cannot certify anything:
two cells pinned at 0/8 are indistinguishable from each other whether they are
twins or unrelated, and 83 of 270 cells are pinned that way. **The test can
refute redundancy for a given pair. It can never establish it.**
