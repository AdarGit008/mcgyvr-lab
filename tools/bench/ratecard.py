"""What a null costs, per task, per ``(model, tier)`` cell (#289).

``tools/bench/reproducibility.json``'s ``matching`` prose priced a null at
*"about 40 minutes to re-measure."* One number, every cell. Compared like with
like — against wall clock at n = 257, which is what that constant was a
statement about — it is **2.0x too high for the cheapest cell and 23% too low
for the dearest**, a 2.66x spread. That is the same defect as the flat
``1.47pp`` bound it sat beside: a constant applied to cells it was not measured
on.

(The first draft of this module compared the constant against *summed task
time* instead — 2.5x, 18%, 3.0x. Those numbers are right for a different
quantity than the one the constant named, and the correction is the module's own
point: state which cost a figure is a figure of.)

This states the price as a **rate** instead, so it multiplies rather than
transfers::

    minutes = 2 * n * rate / 60

A rate survives what a total cannot. New problems are being authored, so any
figure computed against today's task count expires with the corpus; seconds per
task does not.

**The rates were measured under the bar as it stood at `r1-commissioning`.**
The gate is 24-48% of a `ts` cell, so a change to what the gate *does* moves
this card, not only the pass rates. One such change: a crashed linter is an
inconclusive rung rather than a clean pass, which moves where a run stops when
the environment is broken. The rates below predate it. In a healthy
environment the difference is an exit-code check per invocation and does not
show here; in a degraded one it is not bounded by anything measured below.
Re-derive rather than transfer across that boundary.

**Two axes, not one.** Generation scales with the model and the gate does not:
on ``bench-py`` the gate is 0.20 s/task at *both* models, identical to two
decimals, which is what a linter blind to the model's output size looks like.
On ``bench-ts`` it is 24-48% of the cell. A card keyed only on ``model`` would
mis-price every ``ts`` cell, and a single pooled average hides the term that
actually separates the arms.

**The rates are summed task time** — the per-row ``latency_s`` and
``acceptance_s`` the runner recorded. What they miss is model load and harness
startup, and that term is **additive, not proportional**: differencing the
``invocations[0].started`` stamps of consecutive passes in the two r1 sessions
puts it at **1.64-1.72 minutes per pass, mean 1.67**, flat across a 3x spread
in pass duration (8.1 to 24.4 minutes). So::

    wall_minutes_per_null = 2 * (n * rate / 60 + SETUP_MIN)

An additive term behaves the opposite way to the multiplicative one it is easy
to assume: it is ~20% of the cheapest cell at today's n and ~7% of the dearest,
and it dominates any short pass. Pricing a small sweep off the rate alone
understates it.

Measured on 6 of 8 passes — the last pass of each session has no successor to
difference against. Each gap also contains whatever idle sat between passes, so
1.67 is an **upper** bound on setup; that it holds to +/-0.04 across passes
three times apart in length is the argument that it is setup and not idle.

The pairs are not named here. They are read from ``reproducibility.json``'s
declared bounds, so the card prices exactly the runs the bounds were measured
on and a second list cannot drift from the first.
