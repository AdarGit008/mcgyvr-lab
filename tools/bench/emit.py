"""#225 — write one paired bench problem's files from an authored spec.

**This emits files. It does not author problems.** Every word of prose, every
reference solution and every assertion is written by hand; what lives here is
only the part that is mechanical and easy to get subtly wrong — the exact
`contract.yaml` shape the strict schema accepts, the folded `task:` scalar, the
`demonstration`-versus-`acceptance` split that distinguishes a `bug_fix` from a
`function_implementation`, and the `meta.json` sidecar that belongs to the ts
arm alone.

Getting those wrong costs a gate rejection per problem.

A spec is a plain dict. The keys are deliberately the same words the brief and
the gate use, so a spec can be read against either:

    {
      "id": "b228-tide-marks",
      "type": "function_implementation",     # or "bug_fix"
      "file_shape": "single_definition",     # or "multi_symbol"
      "shape": "numeric",
      "steering_band": "f1",
      "prose_ts": "...", "prose_py": "...",  # same problem, idiomatic names
      "iface_ts": "...", "iface_py": "...",
      "stop": "one genuine boundary the prose leaves unstated",
      "ref_ts": "...", "ref_py": "...",
      "acc_ts": "...", "acc_py": "...",
      "buggy_ts": "...", "buggy_py": "...",  # bug_fix only -> target_content
      "target_symbol": {"ts": "...", "py": "..."},   # multi_symbol only
      "risk": "low",
    }

`tools/bench/admit.py` remains the arbiter of whether a candidate is admitted:
it executes both checkers, degrades the declared target, and screens the prose.
The two screens below are not a second gate. They catch the two authoring
mistakes the gate is *structurally unable* to see, because in both the material
is perfectly correct — it is correct about the wrong thing.

**The divergence screen (:func:`divergences`).** A paired problem is one problem
twice, so it is only a fair pair if both languages answer its boundaries the
same way. Some do not. `round(4.5)` is `4` in Python — half-to-even, to keep a
column of rounded figures unbiased — and `5` in JavaScript. A problem stating
"a half rounds up" is therefore two different problems, and the idiomatic
solution passes ts and fails py while both references sail through the gate.
The arm difference then reads as a language finding that is really a defect in
the material. This is the same class as the `ValueError`-versus-`Error` checker
defect that made every past ts-vs-py contrast unreadable.

**The sibling screen (:func:`siblings`).** The gate screens *prose* at 0.55
Jaccard, which catches a problem restated in similar words. It cannot catch a
problem restated in a different domain, and that is the easy mistake to make:
"the next fan speed, wrapping to the first" and "who takes the next shift,
wrapping to the first" share almost no vocabulary and are one problem. What
they do share is the shape of their reference. So this screens the *reference's
token skeleton* — identifiers, literals and types erased, control flow and
operations kept — against every problem already in the tree.

Neither screen can be bypassed by an argument to :func:`emit`. A screen with an
override is a screen that gets overridden at the exact moment it matters.

Usage — author a module holding your specs and call :func:`emit` on each::

    from tools.bench.emit import emit
    emit(spec)                       # writes into tools/bench/tasks/
    emit(spec, root=tmp_path)        # or anywhere else

Or read the screens against what already exists, which is the cheaper order —
authoring against a sibling you have not read costs a whole problem::

    python tools/bench/emit.py --audit          # both screens over the tree
    python tools/bench/emit.py --near b228-tide-marks
