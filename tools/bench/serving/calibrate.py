"""Measure the constants this package was built on, instead of asserting them.

This runs the observations that decide the thresholds and timeouts in
`contract.py`, and writes each sample as it is taken. Incremental on purpose:
the ramp phase is hours long, and a harness that only writes at the end converts
a crash at hour four into the loss of hours one through three.

**Nothing here changes a constant.** It produces the distribution; the value is
a decision, taken with the numbers visible.

Phases, cheapest first, so a short night still yields something:

``fast``
    No model is loaded. Idle-card readings and ssh step durations — which
    decide `IDLE_GPU_MIB` and `STEP_TIMEOUT_S`.

``load``
    Raises ``NotImplementedError``.

``ramp``
    The expensive one. The concurrency ramp across a matrix of configured batch
    widths and token counts, which `RAMP_TOKENS`, `RAMP_REPEATS`,
    `INFERRED_SATURATION_MIN_SPEEDUP`, `PLATEAU_FRACTION` and
    `LATENCY_TOLERANCE` are read against. Every level of every ramp is a row,
    so the thresholds can be re-derived later without re-running the rig.

``sleep``
    What a sampled vLLM sleep looks like on the card, with and without
    ``--enable-sleep-mode``.

    1. ``_card_mib`` returning ``None`` -- the ssh or nvidia-smi failed -- left
       ``freed_mib`` null, ``actually_freed`` null, and on a CONTROL arm
       ``failed: false``, because DE-12 correctly says only the enabled arm can
       fail. A control that read nothing is indistinguishable in the row from a
       control that read a card which did not move, which is the entire finding
       the control exists to establish.
    2. ``/is_sleeping`` not answering made ``endpoint_claimed_asleep`` ``False``
       via ``(None or {}).get(...)``, so ``endpoint_lied`` computed ``False`` --
       "the endpoint told the truth" -- from an endpoint that said nothing.
       ``endpoint_lied`` is phase 1's headline and it was reachable by silence.
    3. A non-200 from ``POST /sleep`` was never checked, and the card delta was
       scored anyway. Nothing was asked to sleep, and the row reports on how
       much sleeping happened.

    None of the three fired on the 2026-08-19/20 campaign -- every cell produced
    real readings -- and all three were un-retryable once written, because a row
