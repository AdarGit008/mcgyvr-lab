"""The llama.cpp backend: llama-server launched directly, with its flags set.

Implements the contract in :mod:`contract`. **This file names no other
backend's module and must not**: it knows how to stop being on the GPU and how
to get itself onto it, and who else wants the card is the orchestrator's
decision, never this module's.

Two launch flags are set here and are not the caller's to choose:

1. **``--parallel`` is always set, and never below the widest level the ramp
   will offer.** :func:`claim` reads ``total_slots`` back off ``/props`` and
   refuses a launch whose readback is below that level: the server runs the
   excess as a second sequential batch, which reads as a plateau.

2. **``-c`` is the TOTAL context and is divided across the slots.** The ramp
   asks for :data:`contract.RAMP_TOKENS` completion tokens on top of a prompt,
   so configs declare ``ctx_per_slot`` and this module multiplies. A raw
   ``n_ctx`` is passed through as given; :func:`claim` reads the per-slot
   window back off ``/props`` and refuses one below :data:`MIN_CTX_PER_SLOT`.

**mmap stays on.** ``--no-mmap`` is never passed and is refused if a config asks
for it: :func:`mmap_gate` weighs host RAM for an mmap'd model.

The flags themselves are described in ``okf/config/llama.cpp.md``.

    **The gate is on ``available`` at the moment of the check, and the moment
    matters.** While the previous cell's server is up, the RAM it holds is
    missing from `available`. :func:`_start` calls this *after*
    :func:`release`, which is the only ordering that reads the memory the model
    will actually get.

    A refusal here is the campaign's intended outcome for an oversized model,
    not an error to route around: the alternative is a cell that runs, thrashes,
    and reports a disk benchmark as a decode throughput.

    **What is weighed is the RESIDENT share, not the blob.**
    ``-ngl 99 --n-cpu-moe N`` puts the non-expert weights and the experts of
    every block from index ``N`` up on the CARD; under mmap those pages are
    read once, uploaded, and are then clean and evictable. They never need to
    be resident at the same time as the CPU-side experts.

    **The refusal is made only if MAX OFFLOAD still failed.** ``fits`` is
    judged at :func:`expert_floor` -- the fewest blocks this card can leave in
    RAM -- and not at the ``n_cpu_moe`` the entry happens to declare. A cell
    whose declared value spills more than the budget but whose floor fits is
    ADMITTED, with ``declared_fits`` false to say so: the model fits this rig
    and the config is what needs moving, which is a finding rather than a
    reason to skip the measurement. Only a model that overflows RAM even with
    the card as full as it can be made is genuinely too big for the host.

    Falls back to the blob-size test when the geometry cannot be read or the
    checkpoint has no experts. That is the right test for a dense model -- it
    has nothing to spill and no ``--n-cpu-moe`` to spill it with -- and for an
    unreadable blob it is the conservative direction.
