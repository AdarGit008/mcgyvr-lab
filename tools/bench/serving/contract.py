"""What every serving backend must implement, and what none of them may own.

**One rule shapes this file: a backend never knows another backend exists.**
Neither file under ``backends/`` imports the other. Adding a third engine is a
third file and a line of config, with no edit to either of the first two and
none to :mod:`run`.

That is not tidiness. An earlier single-module version cleared the machine
unconditionally before every measurement, which meant it stopped vLLM
immediately before ramping vLLM and then measured a server that was no longer
running. The fix is not a smarter conditional — it is that **exclusion is not a
backend's business**. A backend knows how to stop being on the card
(:func:`release`) and how to get itself onto it (:func:`claim`); :mod:`run`
decides who must yield to whom, and that decision is engine-agnostic.

The interface :mod:`run` and ``calibrate.py`` call:

``NAME``
    The name a config uses to select this backend.

``probe(host) -> str | None``
    The base URL this backend answers on, or ``None`` if it is not serving.
    Read-only: it must never start, stop or load anything.

``inventory(host, base) -> list[str]``
    The model ids it can serve.

``release(host) -> dict``
    Stop serving and give up the GPU. **Its own processes only.** Idempotent,
    and safe to call when it was never running.

``claim(host, base, model, serve, expect, **declared) -> dict``
    Make ``model`` served under ``serve``, then **prove it** and return the
    evidence. Raises :exc:`NotCleanError` rather than returning something a caller
    might measure. What "prove" means is the backend's own business — the two
    engines place weights differently and fail differently.

``describe(host, base, model, serve=None) -> dict``
    Everything the backend will say about that model, including
    ``observed.capture``.

``readings(host) -> dict``
    Its own footprint: processes, held VRAM. Used for the machine snapshot.

Everything below is shared because it belongs to no engine: the ramp is
OpenAI-compatible HTTP and token arithmetic, and the machine readings are
``nvidia-smi`` and ``/proc``.

#: (the `repeats` field landed after it ran), so the first `repeat_spread`
#: rows are 2026-08-23's cross-rig ramp, taken WITH `--enforce-eager`: the
#: second attempt won 4 of 9 levels on each rig, and max/min per level was at
#: most 1.015 on srv1 and 1.072 on srv2. That 7% is inside the 8% margin
#: :data:`PLATEAU_FRACTION` leaves, which is why `max` over two is kept: one
#: unlucky repeat at one level would move the saturation read. No spread has
#: been measured with graphs on -- the sweep ran one repeat -- so this is
#: invariant by construction (it does not read a rate) and unmeasured in the
#: new regime, and both halves of that are the record.
RAMP_REPEATS = 2

#: The orders a ramp may offer its levels in (#327). The readers sort by ``n``

#:
#: **D3, 2026-08-19.** 128 was too short to be a throughput measurement: at that
#: length the per-request fixed costs — scheduling, prefill, the first token —
#: are a large share of the reply, so the curve reads the overhead as much as
#: the rate. 475 is an **interpolation** between the two measured columns of the
#: calibration matrix (128 and 512) — a judgement against measured curves, and
#: not itself a measured point.
#:
#: **#356, 2026-08-24: re-derived with CUDA graphs on, and it survives.**
#: D3's matrix was taken under `--enforce-eager`, worth 5.02x on srv2, so the
#: rate its overhead argument was made against was 5x low there. Measured
#: at 128/256/475/1024 tokens on both rigs
#: (`records/evidence/2026-08-24-ramp-tokens/`): at a single stream 475
#: reads 97% (srv1) / 95% (srv2) of the 1024-token rate and 128 reads 81% /
#: 77%. The per-request overhead is not fixed in seconds -- 0.79 s on srv1,
#: 0.22 s on srv2 -- so its share of a 475-token reply is 6.9% / 8.3% on
#: both rigs, and a budget chosen against a share survives the rate moving.
#: Past the knee, 1024 reads BELOW 475: a longer sequence is more KV to
#: attend over per step, a different regime rather than a better reading.
RAMP_TOKENS = 475

#: Long enough that no reply ends early. Unequal replies are what sank the
#: first concurrency method: it read the CLUSTERING of completion times, which
#: recovered a known width on a cold server and dissolved once warm, because
#: the probe prompt hit EOS at different lengths per request.
RAMP_PROMPT = (
    "Write a long, detailed technical description of a sorting algorithm. "
    "Do not stop early. Keep writing continuous prose until you are cut off."
)

#: **The definition of** :func:`saturation_n`, not a tolerance around it.
#:
#: ``saturation_n`` is the lowest offered concurrency whose throughput reaches
#: this fraction of the curve's peak. There is no separate ground truth it is
#: approximating — a throughput curve does not contain a "true" saturation
#: point that this rounds to. Changing this number changes what the field
#: means, so it is stated once, here, and every emitted value carries it.
#:
#: **D2, 2026-08-19.** 0.92 rather than the previous inline 0.95: at 0.95 a
#: curve that is still creeping upward by a percent or two per level reads its
#: saturation point later than the hardware reaches it.
#:
#: **#356, 2026-08-24: re-read on curves that are not 5x depressed.** The 104
#: launched cells of `records/evidence/2026-08-24-config-sweep/` -- 68 with
#: `--enforce-eager`, 36 with graphs on -- were read at 0.90, 0.92 and 0.95.
#: 0.92 and 0.95 agree on every one of the 104; 0.90 disagrees on two srv2
#: graph cells (`g-1.5B-seqs384`: 128 against 256). The plateau this defines
#: is the same object with graphs on. One caveat the sweep cannot remove: its
#: ladder is powers of two, so a knee between levels is invisible to it where
#: D7's dense low end would see it -- the agreement is at the sweep's
#: resolution.
PLATEAU_FRACTION = 0.92

#: Informational only — reported beside the latency plateau, never a gate.
#:
#: Kept because the disagreement between the two plateaus is itself readable:
#: on a wide server they differ by design, since a larger batch is slower per
#: request before any queueing starts. A reader who saw only one could not tell
#: that from a broken measurement.
LATENCY_TOLERANCE = 0.10

#: The floor for **inferring** a saturation point, and it applies to nothing
#: else.
#:
#: **D1, 2026-08-19.** Formerly ``BATCHING_SPEEDUP = 2.0``, which was used to
#: decide whether a server "batches" and, through that, to suppress its width
#: entirely. Recomputed from ``samples.jsonl`` at 512 tokens: a ``> 1.0`` gate
#: reads four of five vLLM widths correctly and declines the fifth with **no
#: wrong answer**, where 2.0 suppresses three correct ones. The 2.0 threshold
#: was separating the engine that batches, at 4, from the one that did not, at
#: 2 — and that is not the job. A
#: declared limit and an inferred saturation point are different quantities
#: and are now different fields; this constant governs only the inferred one.
#:
#: At 1.0 it excludes exactly the degenerate case: a curve whose peak never
#: exceeds its own single-request rate has no rise, so nothing about it can be
#: called a saturation point.
#:
#: **#356, 2026-08-24: the boundary is far from every graphs-on curve.** D7
#: showed 0.02 separating "excluded" from "valid" (srv1 width 1 at 1.00
#: against srv2's 1.02,
#: `mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/archive/evidence-prose/calibration-2026-08-19/README.md`)
#: -- both were width-1 servers under eager. On the 2026-08-24 sweep the lowest max
#: speedup over n=1 is 3.39 (srv1, eager) and 3.61 (srv1, graphs); srv2's
#: lowest is 7.5. Nothing is within a factor of three of the floor, so the
#: constant excludes nothing in the new regime and its sensitivity stays a
#: width-1 property, which no re-derivation of the number moves.
INFERRED_SATURATION_MIN_SPEEDUP = 1.0

#: The floor aggregate rate a level is given time to achieve, in tokens/second.
#:
#: **BL-4, 2026-08-19.** The per-request cap was a flat 600 s, set when
#: :data:`RAMP_TOKENS` was 128. D3 raised the budget to 475 — 3.7x — without
#: revisiting it. A level of ``n`` requests on a one-slot server finishes in
#: roughly ``n * RAMP_TOKENS / rate``, so at 475 tokens a flat 600 s silently
#: required 12.7 tok/s at n=16 and **19.0 at n=24**. The two deep-spill models
#: on the roster sit near or below that line — and D4's withdrawal is precisely
#: what admits them to a ramp for the first time. Their top levels would have
#: timed out, been dropped, and (before this same fix) produced a truncated
#: saturation point reported clean.
#:
#: 4 tok/s is deliberately below anything measured on these rigs: the cap exists
#: to bound a hung request, not to score a slow one.
#:
#: **#356, 2026-08-24: checked against the wider ladder, where it could bind.**
#: The 2026-08-24 sweep offered up to n=384; at n=256 on srv1 a single stream
#: ran 0.79 tok/s, which is BELOW this floor per stream -- and the floor is an
#: aggregate: the level's budget is ``n * RAMP_TOKENS / 4 + 90``, 30,490 s at
#: n=256. Across all 104 launched cells the slowest request used 14.9% of its
#: budget (srv1, n=2, `linear-triton`). A rate 5x higher makes the cap looser
#: still; the direction of the misconfiguration runs away from this constant.
RAMP_FLOOR_TOKENS_PER_S = 4.0

#: Added to every per-request budget, for connection setup and prefill.
#: **#356:** the prompt is short and identical, prefill is milliseconds on
#: either rig, and the first graph replay is paid by the discarded warm-up
#: request in :func:`ramp`, not by a timed level. Invariant to the serving
#: configuration by construction.
RAMP_TIMEOUT_BASE_S = 90.0

#: A card holding less than this is idle: a few hundred MiB is display and
#: compositor overhead on these headless rigs, and a model is gigabytes.
IDLE_GPU_MIB = 500

#: How long a cleanup or reading step may take. Generous on purpose — at 30s a
#: step timed out on a box thrashing with a 36 GB model in page cache and
#: returned nothing, and a cleanup step that fails SILENTLY is worse than none.
#: **#356:** bounds ssh steps -- `nvidia-smi`, `docker rm`, `pgrep`, a page
#: cache drop -- none of which runs inside the engine or reads its rate.
#: Invariant to the serving configuration by construction.
STEP_TIMEOUT_S = 180.0

#: Where every number above came from (#356). A constant can be pinned by a
#: marker in `launch.py` while the run behind it is void, and nothing said so:
#: the D7 campaign's every ramp ran under `--enforce-eager`, worth 5.02x on
#: srv2, and the constants it produced kept governing the next campaign.
#: This table is the fix. Each entry names the run a constant was derived
#: from or re-read against, the date, and whether it was **derived** from
#: that run's curves or is **invariant** to the serving configuration for a
#: stated reason. `tests/test_serving.py` refuses a numeric constant in this
#: module with no entry, an entry naming no run on disk, and an entry naming
#: a constant that does not exist.

    A server with ``k`` slots gets faster as offered concurrency rises to ``k``
    and then stops: past the limit the extra requests queue, so tokens/second
    plateaus while per-request latency grows linearly. The knee is ``k``.

    **Validated against a known value, and the validation is partial.** A server
    launched with a batch width of 8 reads 8, replicated within 1% including its
    reproducible dips — n=12 is one full batch plus a two-thirds empty one, so
    it pays two batch-times for one and a half batches of work.

    Depends on totals rather than on when any individual request landed, so
    unequal reply lengths cannot corrupt it, and every reading carries the
    server's own token counts so throughput is not inferred from wall-clock.

    **This is an EXPERIMENT.** It spends tokens, fills the KV cache and warms the
    prefix cache — which is exactly why the per-run capture may not do it, and
    why concurrency is measured here once per configuration instead.

    plateau column that lost half its rows would stop showing the contrast the
    paragraph below is about.

    That plateau column is stated **at the shipped**
    :data:`PLATEAU_FRACTION` **of 0.92**. It read 6 in the original record,
    which was computed at 0.95 before D2 moved the constant; the vLLM columns
    are unchanged at either value. Re-deriving it here rather than copying the
    old table forward is the point — the number is a function of the fraction,
    which is why the fraction travels with every emitted value.

    The two right-hand columns agree on the engine that batches and disagree on
    the one that does not. Reporting them separately is the whole fix; the old
    ``batches`` boolean, which tried to say which column to believe, is retired.

    **The value is meaningless without its conditions**, so every result carries
    them: the token budget it was measured at and the plateau fraction that
    defines it. A saturation point at 128 tokens and one at 475 are different
    measurements of different things.

    **Levels that did not fully succeed are excluded, not averaged in.** A level
    whose requests partly failed produces a *lower* throughput — which reads as
    "the curve flattened here", i.e. a wrong saturation point rather than a
    refusal. This was live: nothing downstream read the ``errors`` count.
