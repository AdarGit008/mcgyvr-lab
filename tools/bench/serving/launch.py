"""Verify the harness is the harness we edited — the markers, and nothing else.

**Why this file exists.** This lane spent 1.5 h of rig time on a run whose patch
silently never reached the file: the unchanged harness ran, produced a full set of
plausible readings, and nobody could tell from the output. D8 turned that into a
process rule — assert the marker in the file after writing **and** after the
formatter, then launch — and made it one step, because two steps with a human
between them is exactly how the first one gets skipped.

**Why it no longer launches.** The launch half was the second of four live entry
points to the rigs on 2026-09-02, with its own detached driver, its own trap and
its own release path — none of which stamped rig state, product round or workload
digest. ``python -m mcgyvr.serving.run`` is now the one door: its gate 2
(``src/mcgyvr/serving/gate-scripts/02-rig.py``) runs :func:`verify_markers`
before any step of a campaign whose ``campaign.json`` declares ``"serving":
true`` and refuses, having written nothing, when a marker is missing. So D8's
"one step" still holds — the check and the launch are one invocation — it is just
the door's invocation. Running this file as a script does not launch; it says so
and points at the door.
