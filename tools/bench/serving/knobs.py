"""The knob surface: declared, accepted, effective (#357).

Three columns, and only the first is free.

**DECLARED** is what the engine says it accepts: `vllm serve --help=all` run
inside the pinned image, parsed to data per image digest. Zero rig time, but
it does need the container to start, and vLLM's argument parser constructs a
`VllmConfig` while printing help, which infers the device -- so the capture
runs with `--gpus all` on a host that has one. `capture_declared` is that
command; `parse_help` is the parser; the result is one JSON file named by the
digest, so a moved image is a second file and a diff.

**ACCEPTED** is what THIS rig, with THIS model, actually launched. It cannot be
read off column 1: a declared flag can still be refused at launch, and the
split is per rig. It is built from launch attempts, one row per cell, and every
row is in exactly one of these states:

- `accepted` -- the container reached `/health` with the weights on the card.
- `refused` -- the engine exited and its own reason is in the record.
- `refused_reason_lost` -- the engine exited and the record holds only the
  wrapper line (`Engine core initialization failed. See root cause above`)
  because the harness kept 25 log lines and the cause scrolled past. **This is
  a refusal whose reason nobody has**, and the row says so rather than
  inventing one. Re-running the cell with a full log is what fills it.
- `harness_defect` -- the engine refused a value it never received as
  recorded. Detected exactly: the engine's parse error quotes the value it saw
  (`Value {method: cannot be converted`), the record holds the value the
  harness meant to send, and they differ. That is the shell-quoting defect
  that wrote three false refusals per rig into stage 1; the cells are kept and
  are now labelled as what they are. A `harness_defect` row is NOT evidence
  about the rig.
- `untried` -- a declared flag no cell has ever carried. Only enumerable once
  column 1 is captured; until then the count is `{"unknown": true}` with what
  was searched, not zero.

A knob absent because nobody tried it, a knob the hardware refused, and a knob
the harness mangled are three different facts and they never share a label.

**EFFECTIVE** is which knobs moved a number, by how much, and **in which
regime**. It is built from single-flag contrasts: two launched cells on the
same (rig, model) whose flag dicts differ in exactly one key. The parent's
other flags are the context, and the ratio is reported at every concurrency
level both cells ran -- because `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` is inert at n=16 (558
against 530 on srv2's eager baseline) and decisive at n=256 (6,445 against
6,088 with graphs on). One number per knob would hide exactly the thing the
sweep learned.

**Nothing here is reasoned to.** Every row cites the file and the cell it was
read from, and the drift test regenerates the committed surface from the
evidence directory and refuses a difference.
