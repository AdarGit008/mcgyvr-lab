"""The serving configuration, read whole and pinned as two digests.

**What this closes.** `product_sha256` pins the code, `bar_sha256` pins the bar,
`weights_sha256` pins a vLLM checkpoint — and this pins *how the model is
served*. Two runs against one model, one revision and one bar can still
disagree because one server had prefix caching on, or ran a different attention
kernel, or enforced structured output.

**Two digests, because one would be a tripwire nobody could leave armed.**

``serving_semantic_sha256``
    Everything that changes what the model emits: the sampler defaults, dtype
    and KV dtype, prefix caching and chunked prefill, the compilation and kernel
    choices, structured-output enforcement, the seed. This is the number a guard
    could one day key on.

``serving_operational_sha256``
    Everything that does not: metrics flags, tracing endpoints, log verbosity,
    ports. Real configuration, worth recording, and it must not re-baseline a
    round. A single digest would move when somebody enabled a counter, and a
    pin that fires on noise is one that gets switched off.

**An unrecognised key is an error, not a default.** :func:`classify` refuses to
guess. A new vLLM release adding a field would otherwise fall to whichever side
the default named — and if that side were "operational", a setting that changes
output would silently drop out of the semantic pin while the pin went on looking
green. The engines' vocabularies are declared below and
``tests/test_serving.py`` holds the live configs to them.

**Both engines land in one shape.** vLLM states its config as a Python repr on
``/server_info``; llama-server states its own on ``/props``. Different
sources, different spellings, one normalised
structure — so the two digests mean the same thing on either engine.

**The two digests above refuse nothing.** ``pin.py`` compares the semantic one
at open against close and records the result. Only
``serving_resolved_sha256`` (:func:`resolved`) is in ``identity.KEY``.

# --- the RESOLVED configuration (#358) --------------------------------------
#
# **Everything above this line pins what was ASKED FOR.** `serving_config` reads
# `/server_info`, which is the engine restating its own arguments, and the two
# digests are taken over that restatement. Measured 2026-08-24, on the two rigs,
# from one image digest and one identical argument list:
#
#   * `/server_info` differs across the two hosts on FIVE keys, and four of them
#     are consequences of card size (`kv_cache_size_tokens`, `num_gpu_blocks`,
#     `kv_cache_max_concurrency`) or nonces (`instance_id`, and in `vllm_env` a
#     per-launch shared-memory buffer name). The fifth, `quant_config`, differs
#     only in the ITERATION ORDER of a set of layer names — same content, two
#     spellings.
#   * The two servers were nonetheless running different kernels: srv1 resolved
#     `TRITON_ATTN` and the torch sampler, srv2 `FLASH_ATTN` and FlashInfer.
#   * **Neither fact is anywhere in `/server_info`.** It carries
#     `linear_backend='auto'` and `moe_backend='auto'` — the policy word that was
#     asked for — and no attention or sampler key at all.
#
# So a digest over `/server_info` is doubly useless as an identity: it moves for
# three reasons that are not the instrument, and it does not move for the one
# reason that is. That is not a gap to widen the existing digest through. The
# resolved configuration comes from a different place — the engine's startup
# log, where it says which kernel it CHOSE and, when it could not have the one
# it was asked for, why.
#
# The fields below are the ones demonstrated to diverge under identical flags.
# The list is short on purpose: a resolved field earns its place by having been
# seen to differ, not by sounding important.

#: Each resolved field, and where the engine states it. Two sources, because
#: neither alone is enough: the log names the kernels, the config names the
#: numerics, and a field read from the wrong one would be the asked value
#: wearing the resolved value's name.

#:
#: ``kv_cache_dtype`` is the whole set. Measured on both rigs 2026-08-24: a run
#: that passes no ``--kv-cache-dtype`` gets ``cache_config.cache_dtype='auto'``
#: on ``/server_info`` and ``kv_cache_dtype=auto`` in the startup log, and the
#: concrete dtype the cache ends up holding is stated on neither surface. So
#: this field refuses two runs that ASKED differently, and cannot tell two runs
#: apart that both asked ``auto`` and resolved it differently. It is in the

#: hole and is named here rather than left for a reader to discover.

#: ``FlashInfer top-p/top-k sampling unavailable: unsupported compute capability
