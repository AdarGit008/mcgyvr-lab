"""Binding a run to what the serving HOST said, with three falsifiable claims.

Host-side readings are worth more than anything the endpoint will state about
itself — the slot count, the sampler defaults, the serving config digests — and
they are worth **nothing** unless they provably describe the server that served
*this* run. This module is that proof, and it is three claims rather than one
assertion, because there are three separate ways for the connection to be false
and each needs its own evidence:

``same_machine``
    The address the dispatch URL resolves to is one the SSH host reports owning.
    Refutes *"the host readings describe a different box"* — a proxy, a tunnel, a
    load balancer in front of several servers, a hosted endpoint with no host at
    all.

``same_process``
    ``(boot_time, process start ticks, pid)`` read at open and again at close.
    Refutes *"the server was restarted mid-run"*. Boot time is combined with
    jiffies-since-boot rather than trusting the pid alone, because a pid is
    reused and a restarted server can land on the same number.

``same_config``
    The semantic serving digest at open equals the one at close. Refutes
    *"the configuration changed without a restart"*: same machine, same pid, so
    the first two claims both hold while the thing being described has changed.

**A failed claim is recorded, never raised.** ``pinned: false`` says the serving
configuration was not constant across the run, which is a fact *about* the
measurement rather than an error *in* it — the rows are still real. Whether it
should refuse a comparison is a question for ``identity.KEY``.
