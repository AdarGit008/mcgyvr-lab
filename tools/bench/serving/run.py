"""One run of the serving survey: a config in, one result out.

**This is the only module that knows more than one backend exists**, and it uses
that knowledge for exactly one thing: deciding who must give up the card before
somebody else takes it. Backends implement ``release()`` and ``claim()`` and
know nothing about each other, so a third engine is a file in ``backends/`` and
a line of config, with no edit here.

The bug that shape exists to prevent was real. A single-module predecessor
cleared the machine unconditionally before every measurement — which meant that
when it reached the vLLM leg it stopped vLLM, then measured a server that was no
longer running, and recorded the engine as unreachable. No conditional fixes
that; the fix is that a backend is never the thing deciding who yields.

**Order is derived, not configured.** Engines are discovered *before* anything
is cleared, because a survey that clears first can only ever measure whichever
engine it happens to reach first.

**Keys are ``(host, label)`` and never a model id alone.** The same weights
served by two engines are two different instruments, and one model on one
backend under two serving configurations is likewise two rows, which is what
``label`` distinguishes.

``family`` groups entries a config CLAIMS are the same model. It is a claim, not
evidence: the digests in each description decide, and a family whose members
disagree is recorded as refuted rather than quietly reconciled. A family missing
a member — because its claim was refused — states its denominator, so "identical
across 2 of 3, one refused" never reads as "identical".
