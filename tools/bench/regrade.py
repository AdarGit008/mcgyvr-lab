"""#225 — re-score saved completions against the checkers as they stand now.

A sweep's rows are two different facts glued together: what the model wrote,
and what the checker made of it. Only the first costs tokens. When a checker is
found to be wrong — as the `ValueError` asymmetry was, where 104 bench
and 106 reserve py checkers accepted only `ValueError` while their ts twins
accept any `Error` — every rate the project has ever quoted from that arm is
recoverable by running the corrected acceptance over candidates already on
disk, at zero model cost.

**The original rows are never rewritten.** `results.jsonl` records what was
measured on the day, under the checker of the day, and a record that changes
when the tooling changes is not a record. The re-score lands beside it in
`regrade.jsonl` with the checker digests it was produced under, so the two can
always be told apart and neither can be mistaken for the other.

Rows that never reached acceptance are carried forward unchanged and marked
so. A dispatch error is a draw nobody saw, and a parse refusal happened before
any checker ran; re-scoring either would invent an observation. The candidate
text is re-parsed rather than trusted, so a row that used to parse and now does
not is surfaced rather than silently re-graded.

Usage::

    uv run tools/bench/regrade.py records/measurements/bench-*/**/bench-py
    uv run tools/bench/regrade.py --check <dir>   # re-score, write nothing
