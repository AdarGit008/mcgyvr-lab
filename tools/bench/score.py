"""The bench scores the way production does, or it is not measuring the product.

The outcome of a run is the gate's own verdict, never a bespoke scorer.

**Why.** ``run_acceptance`` in ``tools/bundle/measure.py`` scores by running the
contract's acceptance command in a temp directory.
:class:`~mcgyvr.gate.runner.Gate` — the thing production actually ships — runs
that command *last*, behind scope, secrets, structured-data and per-adapter
language rungs. So a worker output that satisfies ``accept.py`` while writing
outside ``scope.allow`` is a **pass** to that scorer and a **fail** in the
product.

**What this changes, and what it deliberately does not.** The tree the
acceptance command runs in is built exactly as ``run_acceptance`` builds it — the
target file carrying the condition's own ``target_content``, the accept file
beside it, nothing else. That is on purpose: holding the tree fixed means any
movement in a pass rate is attributable to the added rungs rather than to a
different working directory. What changes is only that four cheaper rungs now
get to reject first, and that the row records *which* one did.

**The semantic rung is off, and the run manifest says so.** ``semantic=None``
is a declared property of a bench run, not an oversight — see ``gate_rungs`` in
``run.json``.

**One sandbox per task, reset per draw.** The workspace, its git base commit and
the reset are the sandbox's, so the cost is paid once per task rather than once
per draw. :meth:`~mcgyvr.sandbox.base.Sandbox.reset` is what
makes a failed attempt leave no trace in the next.

# published pass one machine-load blip away from being a timeout; 120 s leaves
# it 4.2x. What the wider ceiling costs is runaway time, and the whole campaign
# to date holds 130 timeout rows, none of them passing, so the difference is
# about 3.25 h of rig time spread over every run ever taken.
#
# The empty [30, 120) band is real but small, and is not the argument: 31,062 of
# the 32,601 rows were measured under a 30 s ceiling and so are censored at it.

#
# This is the mechanism the gate designed for the case, not a way around it:
# `_worktree_tree` hashes through a throwaway index with `add -A`, whose
# docstring says ignored paths "are excluded, so a run that only writes those is
# correctly not counted as altering the tree." What the staged tree was missing
# is the .gitignore any real repository would carry. It lands in the base
# commit, so it is never part of the worker's diff and the scope rung never
# sees it.
# `node_modules` carries no trailing slash on purpose. The toolchain is linked
# in as a *symlink*, which git treats as a file, and a `node_modules/` pattern
# matches only directories — so the slash version leaves the link visible to the
