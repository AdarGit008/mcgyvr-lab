"""#225 — is `f1` an instrument, or is it merely in band?

A band's pass rate is a statement about **level**. Being in band is not the
same as having resolution, and level cannot reveal the difference.

`f1` reads 38.9% greedy on the floor unit and no rule in its brief fires. This
reads the other axis: of the cells the band is made of, how many can move at
all? A cell that fails every draw is concordant under any lever, contributes no
discordant mass, and under the ``m >= 6`` wall is worth less toward the
bench's 400 than its nominal count.

**What is measured, and what is inferred.** The observable is variation across
draws — one greedy draw plus N sampled at a fixed temperature, replication as a
substitute for material. A cell that varies is demonstrably reachable by this
model, so a lever that shifts its odds has something to shift. The converse is
weaker: a cell pinned across every draw could still be unpinned by a lever that
supplies information the model lacks. So ``psi_draw`` is **not** ``psi`` and is
not a bound in either direction. It is the cheapest available screen for dead
cells, and it costs rig time rather than authoring. The per-lever ``psi`` stays
#231's to measure.

Pre-registration, fixed before the draws existed:
``mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/archive/sessions/lane/225/2026-08-11-f1-responsiveness-prereg.md``.
