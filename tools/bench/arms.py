"""What the second language arm buys, measured on verdicts already recorded.

The bench authors every problem twice — one prose, a TypeScript rendering and a
Python one — and the denominator is the paired cell. That doubles the
expensive axis, authoring. The question this tool answers is whether the second
arm earns it.

**It is a recomputation, not a run.** Every paired cell already on disk carries
a `ts` verdict and a `py` verdict for the same problem under the same condition.
Joining them is arithmetic over `results.jsonl`; nothing is dispatched and no
model is served. That is the same argument #289 made for subset reproducibility
bounds — a figure a subset of an already-paired set can be recomputed from is
never worth a new dispatch.

**What is reported, and why not one number.** Per run: how many cells the two
arms agree on, and how the disagreements split. Agreement alone is the wrong
read on its own — two arms that both fail everything agree perfectly and
distinguish nothing — so the phi coefficient sits beside it, which is zero when
one arm's verdict carries no information about the other's, and McNemar's exact
p, which asks whether the disagreements lean one way rather than scattering.
A high agreement with a phi near zero and a lopsided McNemar is a different
finding from a high agreement with a phi near one.

**Pooling is refused.** Runs differ by model, condition and bar, and #263
records a confirmed pooling defect in this repository already. Each run is its
own row; the totals line is a count of rows, never a pooled rate.
