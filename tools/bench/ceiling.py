"""What the acceptance ceiling is a bound on, measured rather than chosen (#262).

`score.ACCEPTANCE_TIMEOUT_S` is the one acceptance ceiling the live instruments
apply (`tools/problems/admit.py` imports it). This is the measurement it rests
on, kept as a tool so the figure stays re-derivable rather than becoming a
number in a docstring citing a session nobody can re-run.

Two populations, and confusing them is how a ceiling gets picked badly:

* **references** — every admitted problem's acceptance command run against its
  own reference solution. This is what pool admission screens, and it is cheap:
  the slowest of 514 is well under a second, so any plausible ceiling clears it
  by two orders of magnitude and the population decides nothing.
* **candidates** — the `acceptance_s` field on every row in
  `records/measurements`. This is what the ceiling actually bounds, and the
  question it answers is not "how long does correct code take" but "how close
  did a **slow but correct** candidate come to being called a timeout".

The second question is the one with an answer: read `candidates.slowest_pass`
and `candidates.second_slowest_pass` off the summary.

Nothing here dispatches. References run locally against material on disk;
candidate durations are read out of records already written.

    uv run --no-sync python tools/bench/ceiling.py --out <dir>
    uv run --no-sync python tools/bench/ceiling.py --references   # skip the read
    uv run --no-sync python tools/bench/ceiling.py --recorded     # skip the sweep
