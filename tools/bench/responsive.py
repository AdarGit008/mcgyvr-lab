"""The responsive fraction, per (model + bar) x stratum, from committed runs only.

Issue: `#224 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/224>`_, the first item
its 2026-08-14 amendment added — *"the responsive fraction is reported per
(model+bar) x stratum, never pooled, with the tool that derives it"* — and the
first of the amendment's four corrections: **the responsive fraction is
measured, not chosen.** A required effect size sets a floor on it
(``delta <= psi <= responsive fraction``); it does not define it.

**No pooled row, and that is not a formatting choice.** Both of
``tools/bench/resolution.py``'s objections are carried here unchanged, because
this module reads the same runs:

1. **Across arms.** ``bench-py`` and ``bench-ts`` are not a language contrast.
   They are two bars — ruff's resolved rules against eslint's, and no type
   check on either. A figure pooled over them describes neither instrument.
   This is why the row key here is (model + **bar**) rather than (model +
   language): the arm *is* the bar.
2. **Within an arm.** ``psi`` ranges 0.029 to 0.134 across task types inside a
   single arm — a 4.6x spread, heterogeneity no figure may pool over.

Arm-level rows are printed because a reader will otherwise compute them, and are
labelled so they cannot be quoted as the bench's resolution. Nothing is ever
pooled across tiers.

Three observables, and they are not the same number
---------------------------------------------------

The word "responsive" has been used for three distinct things in this project's
records, and they disagree here by an order of magnitude. Each row names which
one it is.

``headroom``    Cells passing under **either** condition of a named contrast.
                An **upper bound on m**, hence on ``psi``: a cell failing both
                ways is concordant whatever the lever does. Computed by
                ``eligibility.headroom``. It bounds nothing about a *different*
                lever, and nothing about a different bar.
``psi``         The measured discordance rate of a **named lever**. A property
                of the (instrument, lever) pair, never of "the bench".
                ``delta <= psi`` is hard. Computed by
                ``resolution.measure``.
``psi_draw``    Cells whose verdict varies across sampled draws. Its own
                module's docstring is explicit and is preserved here: **it is
                not ``psi`` and is not a bound in either direction.** A cell
                that varies is demonstrably reachable by this model; a cell
                pinned across draws could still be unpinned by a lever that
                supplies information the model lacks.

**The two holes in the answer, and which of them is now closed.** A2 named two.

*Hole 1 — the bar — is closed, offline.* Every multi-draw run predates
``Gate.run`` scoring and its rows carry no ``rejected_by``, so every ``psi_draw``
this project has quoted was measured against the *acceptance proxy* rather than
the bench's bar, while ``headroom`` and ``psi`` beside it were gate-scored. The
candidate texts were on disk and a bar is a pure function of them, so
``tools/bench/gate_rescore.py`` re-scored all of them under ``Gate.run`` at zero
token cost. Both readings are reported below, per (tier, bar, stratum), and the
"How much of the gap was the scorer" table is the separation #224 asked for.

*Hole 2 — coverage — is not, and it needs the rigs.* No committed multi-draw run
covers the full corpus at any tier: the 1.5B's covers 135 of 257 tasks and two
of three strata, and the 7B's covers 34 of 257 and one stratum. Re-scoring
cannot manufacture a draw that was never dispatched, so this one stays open and
``coverage_gaps`` keeps printing it.

**Keyed on (tier, arm).** The committed runs read here carry no ``bar_sha256``
or ``prompt_sha256``, so the labels stand in for the content.
