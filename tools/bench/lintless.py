"""Re-score the norule control with the language rung dropped — correctness only.

**The question this settles.** Check 2's ablation hurt the TypeScript arm more
than the Python arm (``control.py`` prints the per-arm counts). Two explanations
predict that same asymmetry:

* **a language claim** — the rule declares output *shape*, and TypeScript needs
  more shape declared (imports, exports, type syntax), so removing it costs more
  there;
* **an instrument artefact** — the lint bar bites Python five times harder at
  baseline (154 of 257 cells against 32), so most Python cells are already
  rejected before the correctness test runs, and a cell that is already lost
  cannot be lost again.

They are separated by removing the rung that does the crushing. ``Gate.run``
takes its adapters by injection, so ``Gate(adapters=())`` keeps scope, secrets,
structured-data and acceptance and drops format/lint/structure/syntax entirely.
If the Python arm's sensitivity jumps once lint stops suppressing it, the
artefact explanation wins. If Python stays flat with room to move, the language
claim survives a real attempt to kill it.

**No model cost.** Every candidate is already on disk; this re-parses and
re-scores them. It writes nothing into the run directories — the rows record
what was measured on the day, under the bar of the day.
