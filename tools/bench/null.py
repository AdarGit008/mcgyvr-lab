"""The bench's null drift, and the mechanism underneath it (#231 check 1).

``tools/power/report.py --section null`` prints the null: ``d``, the count of
verdicts that differ between two identical greedy runs. This script asks *why*
it is what it is, because a null of the same size can come from two very
different instruments:

**Sampler drift.** The backend returns different text for the same prompt at
temperature 0 — batching, kv-cache reuse and floating-point non-associativity
all do this — and some of that different text lands on the other side of the
acceptance boundary. This is the expected mechanism, it is a property of the
serving stack, which is why the build is pinned.

**Acceptance drift.** The *same bytes* score differently on two runs. That is
not model noise at all; it is the harness being nondeterministic — a timeout, an
ordering, a hash seed — and it would put a floor under every contrast the bench
ever runs that no amount of extra tasks could lower. The two are separated here
because the headline ``d`` cannot tell them apart, and only one of them is
survivable.

Reads the two run directories named below and dispatches nothing.
