"""Whether a figure describes one tier or the whole ladder, stated once.

Issue: `#231 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/231>`_, the sixth
acceptance item — *"Every bench figure states whether it is single-tier or
full-ladder."*

**Why it has to be said out loud.** With escalation live, a floor failure is
rescued by a higher rung and the floor is invisible. A rate of 12.8% and a rate
of 12.8% mean opposite things depending on which of the two produced them: one
says the floor unit solved it, the other says *something* in the ladder did. The
number cannot carry that distinction, so the report must.

**Why a recorded field and not a constant in each report.** Two reports already
printed the sentence as a string literal, and seven other tools that produce
bench figures printed nothing. A literal is a claim the code cannot check: it
stays "single-tier" through the change that adds escalation, and it stays right
by luck until it is silently wrong. So the runner records what it did, and every
report renders that record. ``UNRECORDED`` below is what a manifest written
before the field says, and it is answered rather than guessed at — see
``declare``.

**Why the ladder value exists with nothing producing it.** The floor can move
and no tool may hard-code its tier. A vocabulary with one member is a
vocabulary that will be widened by whoever adds the second mode, under time
pressure, in the same change that adds escalation. Declaring both now costs
nothing and makes the addition a data change rather than a design one.
