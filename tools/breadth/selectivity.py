"""#121/#132 — what breadth is worth when the checker is weaker than ours.

Breadth moves the burden from the model to the checker. One draw and the model
has to be right; eight draws and we only need the check to spot which one is.
So the more draws taken, the more weight the acceptance carries — and the srv1
gains came from tasks that passed one or two draws in eight, which are exactly
the candidates most likely to be "passes the test, still wrong".

Every sweep's acceptance is a hand-written ``accept.mjs`` that pins every
requirement in the contract, and the reference solution passes it. Real
repositories do not have that. Their suites were written to catch regressions,
not to referee eight competing implementations of one change, and #132 records
that we do not know how often a runnable check is declared at all.

This instrument thins the checker and re-selects from candidates already on
disk. No worker is dispatched: the completions were kept by the sweep, so the
only new work is running weaker acceptances over them.

**The thinning rule.** ``accept.mjs`` is split into top-level statements by
bracket depth. A statement that mentions ``assert`` is an assertion; anything
else is setup (imports, fixtures) and is always kept, because dropping it would
break the file rather than weaken it. Strength ``s`` keeps the first ``s``
assertions in file order and drops the rest. Assertion order is the author's,
so the early ones are the obvious cases and the late ones the corners — which
is how a thin real-world suite is thin.

**What comes out.** For each draw budget k and checker strength s, selection is
production's: the first draw that passes the *weak* checker wins. That winner is
then judged by the *full* checker, which stands in for the truth. Three numbers
per cell:

* ``won`` — tasks where the weak checker selected some candidate
* ``true`` — of those, how many the full checker also passes
* ``false`` — of those, how many it does not: the wrong answer we went looking
  for, which is the cost of breadth against a checker that cannot see the
  difference
