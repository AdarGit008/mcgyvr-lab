"""#121 — the first-pass index distribution: the measurement that settles breadth.

Sampling breadth is configuration policy with a default of 1, and one
measurement settles whether 1 is right:
given that a gate-passing candidate exists among N draws, at what index does it
first appear? Concentrated at index 0, breadth is retired — the first draw is
where the passes already are, and extra draws buy wall clock and nothing else.
Spread out is the only evidence that would justify raising the default, and
everything else on offer is a pass@k bound: a ceiling on what selection could
achieve, not a measurement of what it does.

**The draws are serial and there is no early exit.** Production breadth (#119)
stops at the first gate pass; this instrument deliberately does not, because
the whole distribution is the result. An early exit would truncate every
observation at its own answer.

**Two arms, because sampling is not free.** A rung that takes more than one
draw must sample (identical greedy draws are one draw), and moving off greedy
temperature can lower the first draw's own pass rate before breadth pays
anything back. So each task runs once greedy (temperature 0.0 — the anchor,
comparable to the bundle sweep's rows) and N times sampled at temperature 0.7.
The variance cost is `greedy` against `sampled` draw 0;
the breadth benefit is draw 0 against draws 1..N-1.

**The prompt is the shipped assembly.** :func:`~mcgyvr.worker.prompt.build_prompt`
over each task's contract — the bundle selected by adapter, the user message
rendered from ``worker_view()`` — so the distribution describes what production
would dispatch, not a condition that exists only in an experiment.

**A draw passes when ``Gate.run`` passes it.** ``tools/bench/score.py`` scores
every draw in a per-task sandbox over the rungs in ``score.GATE_RUNGS``; parse
refusals are failures by their refusal code. ``run.json`` records the rungs as
``gate_rungs``.

**Every candidate is kept.** Raw completion text lands in ``candidates/``
beside the rows, pass or fail, parseable or refused — replies are the corpus
#184 observes gets discarded exactly where it is free.

**A cell without an observation is not a filled cell (#217).** A
``dispatch_error`` row records that a draw was never seen, so a resume
re-dispatches it rather than skipping it forever; the rows it displaces are
kept verbatim in a sidecar, and the act is recorded in ``run.json``. Every run
directory then states whether an observation reached every cell it set out to
fill — in ``run.json``, at the head of ``summary.md`` and in the exit code —
because the failure this guards against is quiet: the sweep exits 0, the rows
file has the expected line count, and only a summary line that scrolled past
hours ago distinguishes a complete run from one missing a fifth of its draws.

The d1 task set, the ``--selftest`` acceptance runner and the worker plumbing
are the bundle rig's (`tools/bundle/measure.py`), imported by path — the task
set is pinned by the same digests, so a d1 row here and a row there describe
the same twenty contracts.

Usage::

    # verify the task set (no worker needed)
    uv run --no-sync python tools/breadth/measure.py --selftest

    # the sweep (the default tier, d1, is retired: name a live one)
    uv run --no-sync python tools/breadth/measure.py \\

      than on the diagnosable ``PinError`` that module raises for every other
      provenance failure.
    * *A flag* (``--retry-dispatch-errors``) keeps the rewrite explicit, but it
      reproduces the defect's own first failure mode: it requires noticing.
      Nothing fails, and the number that would tell you to pass the flag is in a

    * *Rewrite on resume*, taken here. The deliberateness the run-identity

      requiring foreknowledge: the displaced rows are written verbatim to
      :data:`DISPATCH_ERROR_SIDECAR` beside the rows, the act is announced on
