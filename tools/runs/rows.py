"""The sweep drivers' TSV, read the way a person reads it — and not the way the
journals are read.

``records/evidence/**/*.tsv`` is what ``tools/runs/drivers/lcp_sweep.py`` and
``tools/runs/drivers/vllm_sweep.py`` print: ``### `` marker lines, then rows of
``host \\t label \\t kind \\t k=v...``. It is **not** a journal, and the one habit
that must not travel here is last-write-wins per label. The journals
``_journal`` in ``tools/bench/serving/run.py`` writes are append-only and keyed
by ``(host, label)``; these files repeat a label under every arm.
``2026-09-01-bandwidth-and-ncmoe-floor/srv1-nomma-dp4a-ab.tsv`` carries
``d3b np=8 ctx_slot=2048 c=16384 ncmoe=0`` eight times — four rows under each of
two images — distinguished by nothing but file order and a ``###`` comment. A
reader that collapses by label keeps the second arm and discards the first
without saying so, which is an A/B silently becoming one arm.

So a :class:`Row` remembers its line number and the marker it sits under, and
nothing in this module deduplicates.

The door's gate 8 (``src/mcgyvr/serving/gate-scripts/08-parse.py``) reads every
artifact a step wrote back through :func:`read` before the run exits 0, so the
parser the door trusts and the parser the tests trust are one module object.
``tests/sweeprows.py`` re-exports this module for the tests that import it by
that name.
