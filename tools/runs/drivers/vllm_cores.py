# vLLM co-residency driver.
# args: pairtag  util  maxlen  seqs  kvdtype  levels  tag=model[=util] ...
# The driver runs only under the door and refuses otherwise; its argv reads, for
# example:
#
#   s2-q15q3 0.45 2048 128 fp8 8,32 \
#       s2-q15=Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-AWQ \
#       s2-q3=Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct-AWQ
#
# WHY A SEPARATE DRIVER. vllm_sweep.py runs one container at a time
# (`docker rm -f <RUN_ID>-vsweep` between cells), so it cannot answer what a
# neighbour costs an incumbent.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES. Every model is loaded ONCE and stays resident. Then at each
# level, three measurements against the same loaded pair:
#
#   solo   -- ramp A while B is resident and IDLE      (memory pressure only)
#   solo   -- ramp B while A is resident and IDLE
#   paired -- ramp A and B CONCURRENTLY                (memory + compute)
#
# Splitting it three ways costs no extra model load and separates the two
# costs, which a straight solo-vs-paired delta conflates: a neighbour that is
# merely resident has already taken VRAM from your KV pool before it serves one
# token.
#
# UTIL is a per-server share of the whole card, the CUDA context is on top of
# it, and vLLM refuses at startup when free memory is below util x total
# (-> okf/config/vllm.md, Co-residency). Because the pool is util-sized, the
# solo halves are measured here at the co-resident util rather than read off a
# solo run at another util.
#
# IDENTICAL WORK, EVERY TIME. The request counter is reset before each batch is
# built and the same (prompt, want) list is handed to both servers, so a delta
# between any two rows is contention and never a different prompt draw
# (-> okf/must-read/reading-results.md, the prompt draw desync).

# THE DOOR'S TWO REFUSALS, before argv is read and before docker is touched.
# A bare run of this file would print byte-compatible rows with no stamps — no
# rig state, no round, no workload digest — and nothing downstream could tell
# them from a run that passed every gate. So:
# (1) RUN_ID is minted by the door, python -m mcgyvr.serving.run (gate 5), and
# only there; without it this process was not started by the door and exits 2
# having done nothing.
# (2) VLLM_IMG must be a DIGEST (`repo@sha256:<hex>` or `sha256:<hex>`),
# resolved once by `image_digest` in tools/runs/_common.sh (gate 3). A tag is
# a pointer: the same `img=` on two rows can name two images a week apart,
# which is the floating `:server-cuda` mistake the pin only half ended. There
# is no default image — a default is a tag by another name.
# THE DOOR'S PROOF, before either refusal below. Both variables they read can
# be typed into a shell, and a driver that took them on faith reached a real
# `ssh srv1` by hand with no shim on PATH to stop it. gatelib.door_required
# reads the parent chain from /proc, which nothing can set; a gatelib that
# will not import is a refusal too, not a pass.
