# llama.cpp sweep driver.
# args: model_path mount_dir tag cells...   cell = np:ctx_slot:ncpumoe:levels
# -c is computed as np * ctx_slot, because llama.cpp DIVIDES -c across slots.
#
# The workload is `tools/runs/workload.py`, imported and never copied -- same
# deciles, same SYSTEM text, same seeding as vllm_sweep.py -- so the two engines
# are compared on one workload.
#
# cache_prompt is True, so both engines cache the shared scaffold (the vLLM
# driver leaves automatic prefix caching on). ignore_eos is not sent: output
# length is the sampled budget and the model may stop earlier.

# THE DOOR'S TWO REFUSALS, before argv is read and before docker is touched.
# A bare run of this file would print byte-compatible rows with no stamps — no
# rig state, no round, no workload digest — and nothing downstream could tell
# them from a run that passed every gate. So:
# (1) RUN_ID is minted by the door, python -m mcgyvr.serving.run (gate 5), and
# only there; without it this process was not started by the door and exits 2
# having done nothing.
# (2) LCP_IMG must be a DIGEST (`repo@sha256:<hex>` or `sha256:<hex>`),
# resolved once by `image_digest` in tools/runs/_common.sh (gate 3). A tag is
# a pointer: the same `img=` on two rows can name two images a week apart,
# which is the floating `:server-cuda` mistake the pin only half ended. There
# is no default image — a default is a tag by another name.
# THE DOOR'S PROOF, before either refusal below. Both variables they read can
# be typed into a shell, and a driver that took them on faith reached a real
# `ssh srv1` by hand with no shim on PATH to stop it. gatelib.door_required
# reads the parent chain from /proc, which nothing can set; a gatelib that
# will not import is a refusal too, not a pass.
