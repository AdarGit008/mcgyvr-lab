# vLLM sweep driver.
# args: tag model_ref cells...   cell = util:maxlen:seqs:kvdtype:levels[:extra]
# model_ref may be a HF repo id (HF cache) or /models/... (mounts ~/models).
#
# `extra` is optional and is appended VERBATIM to the engine's argv, with `+`
# read as a space so a cell stays one shell word:
#
#     0.90:2048:8:auto:1,2,4,8:--cpu-offload-gb+6+--cpu-offload-params+experts
#
# It exists because a model larger than the card is a real workload on these
# rigs. Only one of vLLM's two model runners honours a CPU offload
# (-> okf/config/vllm.md, `--cpu-offload-gb`), so any cell whose `extra` asks
# for offload also gets VLLM_USE_V2_MODEL_RUNNER=0, here, rather than in every
# caller.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The workload -- deciles, SYSTEM, mkprompt -- is `tools/runs/workload.py`,
# imported and never copied. Its docstring carries the shared-prefix argument.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# THE DOOR'S TWO REFUSALS, before argv is read and before docker is touched.
# A bare run of this file would print byte-compatible rows with no stamps — no
# rig state, no round, no workload digest — and nothing downstream could tell
# them from a run that passed every gate. So:
# (1) RUN_ID is minted by the door, python -m mcgyvr.serving.run (gate 5), and
# only there; without it this process was not started by the door and exits 2
# having done nothing.
# (2) VLLM_IMG must be a DIGEST (`repo@sha256:<hex>` or `sha256:<hex>`),
# resolved once by `image_digest` in tools/runs/_common.sh (gate 3). A tag is
# a pointer: the same `img=` on two rows can name two images a week apart,
# which is the floating `:server-cuda` mistake the pin only half ended. There
# is no default image — a default is a tag by another name.
# THE DOOR'S PROOF, before either refusal below. Both variables they read can
# be typed into a shell, and a driver that took them on faith reached a real
# `ssh srv1` by hand with no shim on PATH to stop it. gatelib.door_required
# reads the parent chain from /proc, which nothing can set; a gatelib that
# will not import is a refusal too, not a pass.
