"""Two-card serving sweep: one checkpoint, one engine, one card layout per cell.

args: ENGINE CELL...     ENGINE = vllm | lcp
cell = tag:model:layout:p2p:ctx:levels[:extra]

  model    vllm: a HF repo id already in the rig's HF cache (the campaign's
           fetch step puts it there; nothing is downloaded mid-sweep), or a
           checkpoint directory /models/<path>, the container form of
           ~/models/<path>, mounted read-only.
           lcp: /models/<path>.gguf, the container form of ~/models/<path>,
           or /hf/<path>.gguf, the container form of ~/.cache/huggingface/<path>.
  layout   g0 | g1     one card, the other idle (`--gpus device=N`)
           tp2 | pp2   vllm only: --tensor- / --pipeline-parallel-size 2
           layer | row | tensor
                       lcp only: --split-mode over both cards, split by free
                       memory (llama.cpp's default --tensor-split). b10644's
                       CUDA backend refuses row ("does not support split
                       buffers"); tensor is its tensor-parallel successor
           dp2         two single-card replicas, requests alternated between
                       them: the "no model parallelism at all" baseline
  p2p      on | off    vllm: off = NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1 plus
                       --disable-custom-all-reduce, so every collective
                       bounces through host memory. lcp takes `built` only:
                       llama.cpp has no runtime switch this driver trusts.
  ctx      vllm: --max-model-len. lcp: the per-slot window; -np is the widest
           level (or @np) and -c is np * ctx, because an explicit -np splits -c
           across slots (llama.cpp b10644, the 2026-10-02 desk read §Q1).
  levels   concurrency rungs, e.g. 1,4,16
  extra    appended VERBATIM to the engine argv, `+` read as a space and `:`
           kept (the rest of the cell is extra). A word starting `@` is a
           directive to this driver, never passed to the engine:
             @NAME=V      `docker -e NAME=V` (NCCL_*, GGML_CUDA_*, ...)
             @cpuset=0-3  `docker --cpuset-cpus`: the engine sees those cores
             @headroom=N  card MiB kept back per card in the fit prediction
             @prefill=N   PREFILL prompt size in characters (ctx ladders)
             @knob        sustained levels: n=1 is five fixed-length replies
                          (ignore_eos, 256 tokens) with a spread; n>1 is n
                          closed-loop streams for 30 s, steady tokens/s.
                          For A/B-ing one setting; the workload levels are
                          too short (0.7-3 s) for the sidecar to see
             @np=K        the engine's slots (-np K, -c K * ctx; vLLM
                          --max-num-seqs K) apart from the levels, so a
                          one-slot head can be offered two or four requests
             @id_slot=a,b request i of a level asks for slot a, b, ... in turn
                          (llama.cpp's `id_slot`; wraps past the list)
             @stagger=S   request i of a level is sent S * i seconds after
                          the level opens (default: all at once)
           The directives are parsed in mgpu_cell.py, which a test imports.
           A cell whose extra moves weights off the cards (--n-cpu-moe, -ot,
           --cpu-moe) is not fit-predicted: the engine's refusal decides.

What one cell prints, all tab-separated `host label kind k=v...`:

  SKIP      predicted not to fit (weights against the cards' free memory),
            or a ctx below the workload's need; nothing was launched. Host
            memory is not predicted: both engines map the weights from disk
            onto the cards, and a split exists for checkpoints bigger than
            the host's free RAM
  REFUSED   launched and never answered /health, after up to three tries when
            the engine's words are about memory (touching-rigs: a launch near
            the edge fails intermittently)
  CONFIG    what the engine says it built: KV pool, the NCCL transport it
            chose, whether vLLM's custom all-reduce is on, the quant kernel,
            attention backend and graph mode, llama.cpp's per-device model,
            KV and compute buffers (read at -lv 4), ubatch and graph splits,
            card memory after load, and load_s from docker run to /health
  LOG       the raw log lines the CONFIG reader looks for, filed when a
            CONFIG field reads unread, so a changed wording is in the record
  PREFILL   three unique ~1.5k-token prompts, one at a time, max_tokens=4:
            pp = ptok / ttft, the first token in any delta field (a thinking
            model's first token is reasoning); ttft_src=usage when no delta
            streamed and the usage chunk's arrival is the clock. Streaming
            TTFT is the only prefill figure in this file; `agg` is not one
            (okf/must-read/reading-results.md)
  n=K       K concurrent streamed requests from tools/runs/workload.py:
            agg = generated / wall; dec = 1000 / tpot_p50, the per-stream
            decode rate a user sees; ttft_p50; and a rig-side sidecar over
            the level: per card peak power, peak memory, mean utilisation, the
            PCIe link trained to under load (nvidia-smi query), SM busy, PCIe
            rx/tx MB/s mean~peak and clock (nvidia-smi dmon); per core busy,
            the hottest core and %soft (mpstat); swap traffic and lowest free
            memory (vmstat); mean CPU MHz. cards=short when the level lasted
            under 3 s: its 1 Hz samples are too few to read. Also np= and img=
            (the launch the row was measured on) and, for llama.cpp, slots=:
            the slot ids the server launched the level's tasks on, in order,
            read from its own log
  REQ       one row per request of a workload level (not @knob): n= the
            level, i= its index, then send= byte= tok= end=, seconds from the
            level's start to the request being sent, the response's first
            byte (status line), its first token and its end; gen ptok want,
            the id_slot it asked for (- when none), the HTTP status and any
