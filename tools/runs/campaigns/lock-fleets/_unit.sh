# tools/runs/campaigns/lock-fleets/_unit.sh — one cold start of one llama.cpp unit.
#
# lock-fleets (owner, 2026-09-15) measures everything the fleet lock needs. This
# body starts the unit exactly as fleet.yaml states its launch, as
# <RUN_ID>-<unit>, times its wake to /health ok, runs the lock's own harness on
# the rig (mcgyvr/fleet/harness.py: the measure with every sample, then a load
# of W requests filling the unit's N-token window for at most 30 s), reads the
# container's restarts, and files one artifact whole. It judges nothing:
# records/measurements/lock-fleets/assemble_evidence.py does, from the artifact.
#
# REFUSED (exit 2, the artifact written with its `failure`) before a container
# starts, when the unit is not in fleet.yaml, is placed on another rig or is not
# llama.cpp; when its launch.argv or launch.env are not the fields its
# digests-<rig>.json hashed; when the door's --model, --parallel, --ctx-per-slot
# or --ubatch are not the unit's own (data-20 and data-30 sized the run from
# them); when it states a launch.seccomp profile that is not a file beside
# fleet.yaml; or when its image resolves to another digest than the digests file
# recorded (image_id in one file, image in the other).
#
# THE SECCOMP A UNIT STATES (owner ruling, 2026-09-16: "Fix PR: allow
# io_uring"). A unit's launch may state `seccomp:`, a profile file named
# relative to fleet-setup/. It is passed as `--security-opt seccomp=<file>`,
# absolute: the docker CLI reads the profile itself and sends its JSON to the
# daemon, and under the door that CLI runs HERE, against the rig's daemon over
# `-H ssh://<rig>`, so nothing is installed on the rig. A unit that states none
# is launched exactly as before, under docker's default profile.
#
# A FAILED START KEEPS ITS WHOLE LOG (owner ruling, 2026-09-15). When the
# container exits, or does not say ok on /health in 900 s, its whole `docker
# logs` (stdout and stderr, every line, through the door's shim) is filed in the
# envelope as <artifact stem>.<unit>.docker.log before anything removes it, and
# `failure` names that file. The wrapper does not declare it: gate 8 holds each
# declared name to exist, and this one exists only when a start failed
# (lockfleets.keep_log writes it once, never through a link).
#
# A FAILED START FILES ITS EXIT CAUSE (owner ruling, 2026-09-15: "Fix PR, then
# one diagnostic start"). Whenever the step fails after `docker run` — the
# container exited before /health said ok, said no ok in 900 s, or anything later
# failed while it exists — the container's whole State (`docker inspect`, through
# the door's docker shim: ExitCode, OOMKilled, Error, StartedAt, FinishedAt,
# Status and the rest) and the rig's kernel log from the START marker to now
# (`journalctl -k`, through the door's ssh shim) are filed in the artifact's
# `exit` before anything removes the container, and `failure` names the exit
# code and OOMKilled. A read that fails is filed as what it said; it is never a
# stop. The cause is data: assemble_evidence.py check fails the entry for
# exiting, and does not judge why.
#
# The START and END markers (uptime_since, pl1_uw, pl2_uw, ram_mt_s) and the
# rig's /proc/vmstat pswpout and pgmajfault are read at both ends. The markers
# are teed on the rig to ~/mcgyvr-relock/<RUN_ID>.unit and read back, because a
# lock takes the ssh pipe with it (okf/must-read/touching-rigs.md).
#
# Usage: a use's numbered wrapper declares the artifact and runs
#   exec bash ../_unit.sh <artifact>.json <unit> "$@"
# and the door passes the unit's own --model, --parallel and --ctx-per-slot.
