"""lock-fleets: what a step acts on, read from fleet.yaml, its digests and the door.

Owner, 2026-09-15: ``lock-fleets`` is a reusable campaign that measures what the
fleet lock needs. Its two step bodies — ``_unit.sh``, one cold start of one
llama.cpp unit, and ``_move.sh``, one timed switch move on one rig — ask this
file for every fact they act on, by path (``_py lockfleets.py COMMAND ...``;
``lock-fleets`` is not an importable name). The facts come from
``fleet-setup/fleet.yaml``, ``fleet-setup/digests-<rig>.json`` and the variables
the door exports; nothing about any one use of the campaign is written here.

It judges nothing a run measured. It refuses a launch that is not the one
fleet.yaml and its digests name, renders the shell a move runs on the rig, and
writes each step's artifact whole, whatever the step got to.

The planner and the assembler (``records/measurements/lock-fleets/``) load it
too, so a side of a move is classified, and a stamp is parsed, in one place.
