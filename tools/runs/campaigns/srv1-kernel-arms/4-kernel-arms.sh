# tools/runs/campaigns/srv1-kernel-arms/4-kernel-arms.sh — steps 4 (serve) and 7 (crash) of the srv1
# kernel-arms run (`mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/srv1-kernel-arms-PLAN.md`, "Steps"), written against
# `mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/2026-09-02-srv1-kernel-arms-ARTIFACT-CONTRACT.md`.
#
# It drives `tools/runs/drivers/lcp_sweep.py` over `tools/runs/workload.py` —
# the workload the whole campaign shares —
# and prints the contract's rows around it. It never invents a number: every
# field it adds is either read from the rig, read from the engine log, or
# replayed from the workload module's prompt generator.
#
# TWO ARTIFACTS, and the reason:
#
#   srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv   step 4. The llama.cpp arms at n=1,4,8 on resident
#                        models, five replicates, INTERLEAVED at cell
#                        granularity (guideline 1). ONE CELL PER PROCESS
#                        INVOCATION (guideline 2).
#   srv1-moe-slots.tsv   step 7. L2's crash boundary over n=1..12, then L3 for
#                        60 trials at every width L2 actually died on.
#
#   ONE FILE, TWO STEPS, ONE OWNER. `srv1-moe-slots.tsv` is shared with
#   `tools/runs/campaigns/srv1-kernel-arms/6-moe-slots.sh`, which writes step 6's placement rows into it
#   and reserves the crash study — step 7, behaviour 8, the L2 boundary and L3's
#   60 trials — for this script, because that is the kernel question and not a
#   placement one.
#
#   `BEHAVIOUR` in tools/runs/rows.py names the door step `6-moe-slots.sh` as
#   the one producer of that file (contract §4.3), so THAT script is the
#   owner-creator and THIS one is the appender. The order is step 6 then step 7
#   and it is ENFORCED, not documented: `--step crash` refuses to start unless
#   the file already exists and already carries step 6's `### INSTRUMENT step=6`
#   marker. Running them the other way round would leave a file whose only
#   `### WORKLOAD`/`### START` block came from the crash study and whose
#   placement rows were then appended under a `### END` — half a file that the
#   parser would read without complaint. So `--step crash` APPENDS and never
#   truncates. Each writer emits its own `### WORKLOAD`, `### START` and
#   `### END`; `Sweep.stamp()` takes the last of each and `stamped_before()` the
#   nearest preceding, so both blocks resolve. `### INSTRUMENT` names which tool
#   produced the rows that follow it.
#
# GUIDELINE 1 — interleaving. The 2026-09-01 A/B ran all of one arm then all of
# the other, confounding arm with elapsed time and card temperature. Here the
# arm is the INNERMOST loop: replicate, then cell, then arm, and the arm order
# rotates by replicate so no arm keeps a fixed position in the sequence. The arm
# changes every three level rows.
#
# GUIDELINE 2 — one cell per process invocation. The prompt draw comes from a
# per-process `itertools.count()`, so a process that ran levels `1,2,4,8` drew
# different work than one that ran `1,4,8` — measured at 6.2%, larger than most
# effects this run is looking for. Every invocation below passes the driver
# EXACTLY ONE cell argument, and every arm gets the identical level list for a
# given (cell, replicate), so `(ptok, otok_req)` pairs across arms.
#
# `otok_req` is the requested output budget and is NOT `otok` (resolved conflict
# §6.2). The driver prints neither, so `otok_req` is recovered by replaying
# `tools/runs/workload.py`'s `mkprompt()` (the module the driver imports) — the
# same source region `rows.workload_digest` execs — over the same call order
# the driver uses (one warm-up, then n per level). It is a plan, computed from
# the workload module, not a measurement copied from somewhere else.
#
# GUIDELINE 8 — a refusal is a result. Every launch goes through `retry3`; only
# a third failure is believed, and it is recorded as a REFUSED row with the
# engine's own words. No row is ever fabricated: if L2 does not re-crash, no
# CRASH row and no `### BOUNDARY` are emitted and step 7 stays honestly red.
#
# Usage:
#   4-kernel-arms.sh [--dry-run] [--step serve|crash]
#                       [--arms "L0 L1 ..."] [--cells "d3b mling"]
#                       [--crash-cells "mling moss4b"] [--reps N] [--trials N]
#                       [--models DIR]
#
# --dry-run prints the exact command line for every cell and touches nothing.
#
# Through the door only (python -m mcgyvr.serving.run): RUN_ID names the run in ### START,
# ### ROUND records the product round gate 1 checked, the files land in
# $RUN_OUT_DIR, and an arm's tag is resolved to a digest ONCE (image_digest,
# gate 3) before the driver sees it — the driver refuses a tag.
#
# ONE FILE, TWO DOOR STEPS. The door guards what a step file DECLARES, and one
# declaration cannot be write-once for step 4 and append-only for step 7, so
# each campaign step is its own door step: `--step .../4-kernel-arms.sh`
# is step 4 (serve; this file, declaring the file it creates) and
# `--step .../7-crash.sh` is step 7 (7-crash.sh, declaring
# `RUN_APPENDS: srv1-moe-slots.tsv` and exec'ing this file with --step
# crash). The door exports RUN_STEP — the step it started — and the mode is
# held to it below; `--step all` is refused through the door.
