# tools/runs/campaigns/srv1-kernel-arms/5-correctness.sh — campaign step 5, and the only producer of
# `$RUN_OUT_DIR/correctness.json` (the filed copy is
# `records/evidence/2026-09-03-srv1-kernel-arms/correctness.json`).
# Behaviour 11, `tests/test_a_faster_arm_that_answers_differently_has_not_won.py`.
# "Guideline N" and "behaviour N" are those of
# `mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/srv1-kernel-arms-PLAN.md`.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The arms deliberately run different kernels. Different reduction order gives
# different logits, and the 2026-09-01 A/B already shows the symptom: same
# prompts, `temperature: 0`, and yet `otok` 214 against 221 on one cell with
# `early_stop` 3/4 against 2/4. The arms did different amounts of work and
# nothing checked whether they did the same *work*. A faster arm that answers
# differently has not won — it has computed something else.
#
# Guideline 9: score with what exists. No diff harness is written here.
#   tools/breadth/measure.py --endpoint ... --protocol openai --tier bench-py
#     drives the 257-problem paired corpus through the production gate
#   tools/bench/null.py
#     compares two runs by `candidate_sha256`, separating SAMPLER drift
#     (different bytes) from ACCEPTANCE drift (identical bytes scoring
#     differently). Only one of those is survivable.
#   tools/bench/responsiveness.py:wilson
#     the campaign's one Wilson implementation — the bound is the 95% upper
#     limit on d/n, never `d/n` itself, because a bound of 0.00pp would claim
#     the instrument is exact and 257 cells cannot establish that.
#
# EVERY ARM PRICES ITS OWN NULL FIRST. `tools/bench/reproducibility.json`
# declares that a bound describes a run only when model, tier, gate_rungs,
# **serving_build** and cells all match it, and every arm in this campaign is a
# new `serving_build`. So no committed bound covers any of them, and this script
# measures two identical runs per arm before any arm is compared to any other.
# That is what `test_each_arm_priced_its_own_null_before_being_compared`
# checks: a bound borrowed across builds is a wrong published effect.
#
# `null.py`'s CLI walks both bench tiers at once; this reads its `compare()`
# instead, so one tier can be scored on its own exactly as guideline 9 names it.
# It is the same function, not a second implementation of it.
#
# THE VERDICTS ARE THE LADDER'S, AND ONLY THE LADDER'S. `verdicts[]` names the
# speed winner read out of `srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv` — the controlled study, one
# variable per rung, inside one engine — through `tools/runs/rows.py`, the one
# parser. `srv1-vllm-arms.tsv` is deliberately NOT read: guideline 5 makes B1 vs
# B2 a capability probe and not a ranking, and importing a "winner" from it
# would put a rank on a file that exists to say what the card can do. If the
# arm this file names as fastest was never scored here, the test fails — that
# is the behaviour working, not a bug to route around.
#
# Nothing here fabricates. An arm whose build nothing recorded is refused rather
# than given a plausible string, and a bound is never written for a comparison
# that shared no cells.
#
# THE STEP SERVES ITS OWN ARMS. The door is the one executable allowed to start
# a container on a rig, and only the step it starts may do so on its behalf, so
# an endpoint is refused. `--arm ARM=IMAGE`: the tag is resolved to a digest ONCE before
# anything starts (gate 3), one container per arm runs as `<RUN_ID>-<ARM>` (so
# gate 7 finds a leftover), on one host port, one arm at a time — the card
# holds one — and is removed before the next arm comes up. `serving_build` in
# correctness.json is `llama.cpp@<tag>@<digest>`, the vocabulary step 6 writes,
# never a string the caller typed.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/runs/campaigns/srv1-kernel-arms/5-correctness.sh [--dry-run] \
#       --gguf /data/models/dense/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf \
#       --model qwen2.5-coder-1.5b --reference L0 \
#       --arm L0=llamacpp:b10644-L0 --arm L2=llamacpp:b10644-L2 \
#       --arm L3=llamacpp:b10644-L3
#
#   --arm ARM=IMAGE   ARM matches [ABL][0-9], the campaign's one arm vocabulary.
#                     IMAGE is the tag the arm was built and stamped as; the
#                     step resolves it to a digest and serves that. An endpoint
#                     here is refused: a server this step did not start is one
#                     the door did not start.
#   --gguf PATH       the checkpoint every arm serves. Required, must exist:
#                     a wrong path would be measured silently.
#   --reference ARM   the arm every other arm's drift is measured from.
#   --model NAME      the served name (llama-server --alias) measure.py
#                     dispatches to. Every arm in one invocation serves the SAME
#                     checkpoint under the SAME name in the SAME engine: a drift
#                     measured across engines is guideline 5's forbidden row
#                     wearing a correctness hat.
#   --arms-tsv PATH   the serve step's srv1-lcpp-arms.tsv the verdicts are read
#                     from (default: the one beside this run's artifact). An
#                     input: the door's envelope is dated, and a step 5 run on
#                     a later day than step 4 has no such file beside it.
#   --port N          host port the one container listens on (default 8081).
#   --ctx N           llama-server -c (default 4096; bench-py prompts are
#                     ~700 tokens and the reply cap is 768).
#   --tier TIER       default bench-py (guideline 9's tier).
#   --draws N         sampled draws per task, default 1. Only the greedy arm is
#                     read here; this is the floor the instrument will run at.
#   --api-key-env NAME  passed through to measure.py. The NAME, never the key.
#   --dry-run         print every command line, in order, and exit.
