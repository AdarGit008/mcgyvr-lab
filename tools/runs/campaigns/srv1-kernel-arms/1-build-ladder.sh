# Campaign steps 0 and 1 (`mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/srv1-kernel-arms-PLAN.md`,
# "Steps"; "guideline N" below is that plan's):
#
#   0  static   cuobjdump L0..L3      free, can end the campaign early
#   1  build    L0 L1 L2 L3 L4 A3     srv2 builds, direct-push to srv1
#
# Step 0 is not a separate pass over somebody else's binaries: `cuobjdump` runs
# inside each build, on the `libggml-cuda.so` that build just produced, and its
# counts are baked into the image as `/app/kernels.txt`. An image that already
# carries this run's labels is REUSED rather than rebuilt, so re-running the
# script after the images exist is the "free" step-0 pass the doc asks for.
# Before a single BENCH row is written the ladder is GATED (guideline 6): L0/L1
# must contain tensor-core instructions and L2/L3 must not. If they do not, the
# script says so loudly and exits non-zero — no rig time is spent on a mechanism
# that did not take.
#
# THE GATE IS PER ARCH IMAGE, AND IT JUDGES ONLY WHAT THE CARD CAN LOAD. A fat
# binary holds one image per `-gencode` target and the device loads exactly one
# of them, so counting `mma.sync` over the whole `cuobjdump` output answers a
# question about images that never execute. Measured on this ladder's own
# builds: L2 and L3 each report 137748 `mma.sync` lines and ALL 137748 are in
# their sm_80 PTX image; their sm_61 image has none, and neither arm has any
# SASS at all (the arch list is virtual-only). srv1 is compute capability 7.5,
# so its driver can JIT sm_61 and cannot touch sm_80 — on the path srv1 actually
# loads, mma.sync is ABSENT. The mechanism took. A whole-binary `grep -c` said
# it had not and would have hard-stopped the campaign on a false positive.
#
# So: the counts are taken per arch image, SERVE_HOST's compute capability is
# read off the card, the verdict comes from the single image that capability
# selects (highest target <= cc; a PTX-only image is JITted, a SASS image is
# loaded as it is), and the whole per-arch breakdown is written into the KERNELS
# stamp so a reader recomputes the verdict rather than trusting one number.
# There is no override flag. A gate that can be waved through is not a gate.

# Resolved conflict §6.4: they are the step-3 `llama-bench` numbers, copied out
# of `srv1-llama-bench.tsv` and re-filed beside the stamps. So this script runs
# either side of step 3 and it must be told which:
#
#   pass 1   1-build-ladder.sh --stage build     campaign step 1
#            Builds, gates the mechanism, writes the stamps. No BENCH rows: the
#            instrument has not run yet. Exits 0 saying what is still owed.
#   step 3   3-llama-bench.sh                    the instrument
#   pass 2   1-build-ladder.sh                   (--stage all, the default)

#
# The default stage REFUSES TO START when `srv1-llama-bench.tsv` is absent —
# checked before a single build, so an out-of-order run costs nothing and leaves
# nothing — and it exits non-zero if any built rung ends up with no row. `--stage

# WHY PER ARCH IMAGE. A fat binary holds one image per `-gencode` target and a
# device loads exactly one of them, so a `grep -c` over the whole `cuobjdump`
# output conflates images the device can load with images it cannot. Measured on
# this ladder's own builds: L2 and L3 each report mma_sync_ptx=137748 and all
# 137748 are in their sm_80 PTX image. srv1 is compute capability 7.5 and cannot
# load sm_80 at all; on the sm_61 image it does JIT the count is 0. The old gate
# read the 137748, called the mechanism un-taken and would have hard-stopped the
# campaign on a mechanism that had in fact taken.
#
# `cuobjdump --dump-sass` prints the PTX images' HEADERS too, arch line and all,
# so the section kind is tracked and only `Fatbin elf code:` sections are counted
# as SASS. An arch that appears in the PTX dump and in no elf section is

# is applied afterwards by `label_build_facts`, read out of the image's own
# /app/commit.txt. `image_sha256` cannot be a label at all: an image's id is a
# hash of its own metadata, so a label naming it cannot exist. The consumer has

# `{{.Id}}` -- and that is the whole of the exception. Every other key is set
