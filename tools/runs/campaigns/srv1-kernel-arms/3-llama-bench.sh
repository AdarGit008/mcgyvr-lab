#
# Campaign step 3 (`mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/srv1-kernel-arms-PLAN.md`, "Steps";
# "guideline N" below is that plan's, and section numbers are those of
# `mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/2026-09-02-srv1-kernel-arms-ARTIFACT-CONTRACT.md`):
#
#   3  bench  llama-bench -p 512,2048 -n 128 -r 9 -fa 0,1
#             x {L0,L1,L2,L3,L4,A3,A1}
#
# A1 IS ON THAT LIST. `server-cuda-b10644` has no `/app/llama-bench` file, and
# it ships `libllama-bench-impl.so` and an `/app/llama` dispatcher that lists
# `bench` in `llama help all`. So A1 is benched as shipped, through
# `/app/llama bench` (resolve_bench_entry), and L0 is not the mandatory
# baseline.
#
# This file is the INSTRUMENT RECORD. Guideline 3: `prefill=` from the sweep
# drivers is `pin/wall` over the same wall as `agg = gen/wall`, so `prefill/agg`
# is `ptok/otok` identically and says nothing about prompt processing. The only
# prefill verdict this campaign may quote comes from here, and from nothing
# else. `srv1-build-ladder.tsv` re-files one row per rung out of this file
# (ARTIFACT-CONTRACT.md §6.4); it is a projection, never a second measurement.
#
# Two properties are asserted here and nowhere else
# (tests/test_a_prefill_verdict_needs_an_instrument_that_measures_prefill.py):
#
#   reps / stddev  a point estimate from three draws is not a measurement.
#                  `reps` is COUNTED from the sample array llama-bench reports,
#                  not copied off the -r flag: a flag records what was asked
#                  for, and this column has to record what was done.
#   fa=0 and fa=1  the arch change moves ggml_cuda_get_best_fattn_kernel on the
#                  same turing_mma_available test that moves MMQ. One number
#                  for both attributes the gain to whichever kernel the reader
#                  already believed in.
#
# What lands in the artifact (ARTIFACT-CONTRACT.md §5.4):
#   ### TOOL name=llama-bench                                       (§2.10)
#   ### WORKLOAD digest=none comparable_with=microbenchmark-only    (§2.1, §6.4)
#   ### START / ### RIG / ### END                                   (guideline 7)
#   BENCH rows: arm= fa= pp= tg= reps= stddev= ...
#   REFUSED rows where a tool or a launch was missing                (guideline 8)
#
# NO `n=<int>` rows are emitted, so `sweep.levels()` is empty and
# `sweep.levels() or of_kind("BENCH")` resolves to the BENCH rows (§5.4).
#
# The step runs on the operator's machine: ### START / ### RIG / ### END are
# read off $RUN_HOST over ssh by _common.sh's rig_snapshot, and docker is the
# door's shim to that host.
#
