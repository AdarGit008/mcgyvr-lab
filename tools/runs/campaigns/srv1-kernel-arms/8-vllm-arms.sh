#
# WHAT THIS ASKS, AND WHAT IT MUST NEVER BE READ AS
# -------------------------------------------------
# A CAPABILITY probe, inside vLLM only: srv1's TU116 die reports compute
# capability 7.5 with the tensor cores removed, Marlin's sm75 path is `mma.sync`
# PTX that this silicon microcodes, so — does vLLM offer this card a path that
# is not that, and what does it cost? Guideline 5: no number in this file may be
# compared with a llama.cpp row. The two engines differ in scheduler, batching,
# KV management and quantisation format; a tok/s ratio across them measures two
# stacks. **B1 vs B2 is the only pair this file contains**, which is why the
# artifact carries no llama.cpp arm, no cross-engine field and no ratio.
#
# THE PAIR (B2-CHECKPOINT.md)
#   B1  --linear-backend marlin    -> MarlinLinearKernel   (mma.sync on sm75)
#   B2  --linear-backend exllama   -> ExllamaLinearKernel  (__hfma2, no mma.sync)
# One flag, one variable, one checkpoint. A `--quantization gptq` vs
# `gptq_marlin` contrast is INVALID in v0.26.0 — both strings map to
# `AutoGPTQConfig` (`get_quantization_config`'s `method_to_config` in
# `vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/__init__.py` @ v0.26.0), so that contrast would print two flags and run one kernel. It is
# not implemented here.
#
# `kernel_observed=` is read from the engine's own line,
# `Using {Marlin,Exllama}LinearKernel for AutoGPTQLinearMethod`
# (`AutoGPTQLinearMethod.create_weights` in
# `vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/auto_gptq.py` @ v0.26.0)
# — never from the flag. A flag that parses is not a kernel that ran.
#
# THE CHECKPOINT. srv1 also holds `Qwen/Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B-Chat-GPTQ-Int4`, which
# is unusable here: it is MoE, so `--linear-backend` would bind only its
# attention and dense projections while the experts route through
# `--moe-backend`, and it does not fit a 6144 MiB card (B2-CHECKPOINT.md,
# section (A)). The pair runs on the DENSE
# `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4`:
# 1.071 GiB of weights on a 6144 MiB card, dense Qwen2ForCausalLM. Its
# quantisation parameters live in `config.json` under `quantization_config` —
# these repos ship NO `quantize_config.json`, so a script that checks
# that filename reports "missing config" for exactly the right checkpoints. The
# requirement chain, all of it a hard gate before either launch:
#   bits=4 sym=true  -> `AutoGPTQConfig.TYPE_MAP` (@ v0.26.0) gives uint4b8, the type
#                       ExllamaLinearKernel accepts; anything else is not it
#   group_size=128   -> divides 1536 and 8960, exllama's can_implement
#   desc_act=false   -> keeps has_g_idx False and the weight permute out of the
#                       arm (not a hard gate at TP=1; still held)
#   torch_dtype fp16 -> "Exllama only supports float16 activations"
# A mismatch is a REFUSED row, not a warning: a checkpoint's name is not
# evidence of its format (`nemotron-30b-awq/` resolves as compressed-tensors).
# The verifier also reads every weight byte, which is what makes a dangling HF
# blob symlink fail here, loudly, instead of at launch.
#
# THE POOL IS PINNED, NOT LEFT TO FLOAT. Under `--gpu-memory-utilization` the KV
# cache is whatever survives the weights, so if the two kernels' scratch buffers
# differ the pools differ, the driver's width gate drops different rungs, and
# the file compares two schedulers rather than two kernels. Both arms therefore
# pass `--kv-cache-memory-bytes` (the knob fleet-setup/fleet.yaml pins on its
# vLLM units; here 1,879,048,192 B / 28,672 B per token = 65,536 tokens), and the
# engine's own `GPU KV cache size:` line is compared across the arms afterwards.
# An unequal pool does not silently become a verdict — it forces `unresolved`.
#
# GUIDELINE 8. A refusal is a result: every launch goes through `retry3`, and a
# B2 that never came up is written as a REFUSED row carrying `checkpoint_quant`,
# `tries>=3` and the engine's own words — resolved conflict §6.3. Unverified risk
# (B2-CHECKPOINT.md, residual risk): `AutoGPTQLinearMethod.__init__` calls
# `verify_marlin_supported()` unconditionally, before the kernel chooser runs,
# so B2 may die with a Marlin-worded message. That is a finding and a REFUSED
# row, not a setup error, and this script says so on stderr when it sees one.
#
# Nothing here fabricates. Every field is read from the engine log, the driver's
# stdout, the checkpoint's own config.json or the live rig; a value that could
# not be read stops the run with a message instead of acquiring a placeholder.
