# tools/runs/_common.sh — the one emitter every campaign step under
# `tools/runs/campaigns/` sources. The door is `python -m mcgyvr.serving.run`
# (src/mcgyvr/serving/run.py): it runs the gates around a step and exports the
# run to it, and a step reaches the rig only through the door's `ssh` and
# `docker` shims (gate-scripts/bin), which land on --host: rig_snapshot and
# image_digest prove the door first (gatelib.under_door, read from /proc) and
# resolve the shim by path from RUN_BIN, never from $PATH. Written against
# `mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/2026-09-02-srv1-kernel-arms-ARTIFACT-CONTRACT.md` (the
# authority) and the parser it cites, `tools/runs/rows.py` (the parser the
# door trusts and the parser the tests trust are one module). Section numbers
# below are that contract's; "guideline N" is a guideline of
# `mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/srv1-kernel-arms-PLAN.md`; "gate N" is an entry of
# run.py's SEQUENCE — the script under src/mcgyvr/serving/gate-scripts/ that

#                                return. Nothing here ever substitutes a

#                                fabricated row is the one unacceptable outcome.
#   stamp NAME [k=v ...]         §1.6 — a `### NAME k=v ...` marker. Enforces
#                                both rules the parser now RAISES on: the name
#                                is a token that is not itself k=v
#                                (`_stamp_name`, §6.6), and no value may contain
#                                whitespace (`_stamp_fields`, §6.7).
#   row LABEL KIND [k=v ...] [-- free text ...]
#                                §1.1-§1.4 — `host<TAB>label<TAB>kind<TAB>k=v...`.
#                                Fields are TAB-separated; a field value carrying
#                                whitespace is refused. Anything after `--` is
#                                emitted as the single free-text `tail` field
#                                (§1.3), which may hold spaces.
#   arm_label ARM CELL           §1.5, §3.2, resolved conflict §6.1 — the one
#                                labelling convention, `<ARM>-<cell>`, with ARM
#                                matching ARM_PREFIX `[ABL][0-9]`
#                                (`rows.py:ARM_PREFIX`).
#   rig_snapshot                 §2.2/§2.3 — reads the live rig, one `k=v` per
#                                line, over `ssh "$RUN_HOST"`: gate 2's own
#                                reader (src/mcgyvr/serving/gate-scripts/
#                                rig-snapshot.sh) is shipped on stdin, so the
#                                step and the door read one machine one way.
#                                Never the machine this step runs on.
#   rig_stamp                    §2.2 — `### RIG` carrying all six RIG_FIELDS
#                                (`rows.py:RIG_FIELDS`) plus the card and CPU
#                                identity. Emit once before the first row and
#                                re-stamp per arm (`test_a_row_without_...:9-11`).
#   start_stamp / end_stamp      §2.3 — `### START` (with
#                                `pl1_source=constraint_0_power_limit_uw`) and
#                                `### END`, both carrying `run_id=$RUN_ID`: gate
#                                8 holds a run's START, ROUND and END to the id
#                                and round the door exported, so a file whose
#                                stamps name another run — or none — is not
#                                green. start_stamp also records the reading
#                                that rig_assert_unchanged compares against.
#   rig_assert_unchanged         §2.3 and guideline 7's "start equals end" — a
#                                fresh read, compared field by field with the
#                                one start_stamp took. Loud on any difference.
#   rig_assert_declared HOST [SNAPSHOT]
#                                gate 2 — the rig compared with its DECLARATION
#                                (`tools/runs/hosts.json[HOST].rig`, the keys
#                                in RIG_DECLARED_KEYS), not only with itself:
#                                start==end cannot catch a rig that moved
#                                BEFORE a run. Loud, naming the key and both
#                                values.
#   round_stamp                  gate 1's receipt — `### ROUND id=
#                                product_sha256=` from RUN_ROUND and
#                                RUN_PRODUCT_SHA256, which gate 1 exports after
#                                `tools/bench/product.require_pinned()` passed.
#                                Fails when either is unset: a round nobody
#                                checked is not stamped from a guess.
#   image_digest TAG             gate 3 — ONE `docker image inspect`, and the
#                                tag becomes a digest (RepoDigests for a
#                                registry image, Id for a local build). A tag
#                                is a pointer: the same `img=` on two rows can
#                                name two images a week apart, which is the
#                                floating `:server-cuda` mistake the pin only
#                                half ended. Drivers refuse anything else.
#   workload_stamp MODULE        §2.1 — `### WORKLOAD digest=... driver=...`.
#                                MODULE is `tools/runs/workload.py`, the one
#                                file every driver imports its prompts from.
#                                The digest is computed by
#                                `tools/runs/rows.py:workload_digest()` itself,
#                                through `uv run --no-sync python`; a second
#                                implementation would be a second thing to drift.
#   microbench_stamp             §2.1/§6.4 — `### WORKLOAD digest=none
#                                comparable_with=microbenchmark-only`, owed by
#                                BOTH microbenchmark files.
#   refused LABEL [k=v ...] -- REASON
#                                §3 and resolved conflict §6.3 — a REFUSED row
#                                carrying `checkpoint_quant`, `tries>=3` and a
#                                reason over 40 characters. Guideline 8: a
#                                refusal is a result. `checkpoint_quant` is
#                                either a value read off the checkpoint or one
#                                of exactly two sentinels — `none` (no
#                                checkpoint was involved) or `unread` (one was,
#                                and its quantisation was never read). A
#                                home-made third spelling is rejected.
#   retry3 CMD [ARG ...]         guideline 8 — three attempts before a refusal is
#                                believed; sets RUN_TRIES to the attempt count
#                                for `refused` to record.
#
# Sourcing this file executes nothing and sets nothing. Every function is safe
# under `set -euo pipefail`.
#
# Environment read (never required, never fabricated from):
#   RUN_HOST          host column, and the rig rig_snapshot reads over ssh;
#                     exported by the door (gate 5). Defaults to `hostname`
#                     for the column only — a snapshot refuses without it.
#   RUN_REPO          repo root; default `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
#   RUN_RETRY_SLEEP   seconds between retry3 attempts; default 5.
#   RUN_ID            minted by the door (gate 5, 05-envelope.py); start_stamp
#                     writes it as `run_id=` and refuses without it.
#   RUN_ROUND / RUN_PRODUCT_SHA256
#                     exported by the door (gate 1, 01-round.py); round_stamp
#                     writes them.
#
# There is no seam. A test that needs a rig or a daemon answered puts an `ssh`
# or `docker` of its own first on PATH — the shim, having admitted the host,
# execs the next binary of that name — and runs under the door or a stand-in
# whose path ends in mcgyvr/serving/run.py, because nothing here reaches a
# rig without proving the door; nothing here reads a variable that names a
# substitute, because a variable that replaces a reading is a variable that

    # `refused()` demands checkpoint_quant on every refusal, but a build that
    # never compiled and an image with no llama-bench in it have no checkpoint
    # to read. Four spellings of that hole were in circulation across the eight
    # scripts (`none`, `unread`, `unread-no-quantization_config`,
    # `unread_the_loader_never_printed_it`), which is four ways for a reader to
    # miss that they are the same fact. One vocabulary, documented in
    # ARTIFACT-CONTRACT.md §6.3:
    #
    #   none     no checkpoint was involved at all. Nothing was loaded, so there
    #            is nothing to read: a build failure, a missing binary, an image
    #            with no cuobjdump record.
    #   unread   a checkpoint WAS involved and its declared quantisation was
    #            never read — the loader died before it printed, or the repo
    #            carries no quantization_config. WHICH of those goes in the
    #            reason, where a reader will look for it; it is not a third word.
    #
    # Anything else must be a value actually read off the checkpoint. A near-miss
    # spelling is refused here rather than filed as if it were one.
