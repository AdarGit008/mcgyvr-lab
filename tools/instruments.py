"""#230 — which task sets are instruments, declared once and read by everyone.

*The instrument is declared, and protected at the point of entry.* Before this
module the declaration existed as a convention repeated in one place and absent
from two: ``tools/problems/admit.py`` knew the pool must not collide with the
bundle sets, while ``tools/replies/pin.py`` and
``tools/finetune/build_dataset.py`` had no concept of a set they must not draw
from at all. That is how #189 came to train on 622 examples drawn from ``d1`` —
which **is** ``tools/bundle/tasks/``, byte for byte — and score the result on
the same twenty contracts.

``tools/instruments.json`` is the declaration; this module reads it and answers
one question three ways, because a run can hide its provenance in three
different places:

``tier``
    What the rig called the set. Catches every run of a declared tier however
    its contracts have since been edited — and they have been: ``d1``'s digests
    moved twice, so a content check alone would miss the older runs.

``ids``
    Whether the run's task ids fall in the instrument id space (``t01``…), as
    opposed to the pool's (``p001-…``). This is the rule that covers the
    cross-language case — one id names a contract in both arms, so a Python run
    of ``t01`` is a run of the same instrument — and it is also the only rule
    that fires on the two capture-bearing runs that recorded no tier at all.
    It is sound *because* ``admit.py`` reads this same declaration and refuses
    a pool problem that collides with an instrument id.

``digests``
    ``sha256(dumps(contract))`` per task, the same digest the rigs pin as
    ``tasks_sha256``. Catches a declared set reached under an undeclared name —
    a copy, a rename, a new tier serving old contracts.

Any one of the three is enough. They are reported separately so an error can
say *why* a run is instrument material rather than only that it is.

A run that answers none of the three questions — no tier, no task digests — is
not "clean", it is **unclassifiable**, and this module says so rather than
guessing. Provenance that cannot be stated is the thing the corpus discipline
exists to replace.

#240 added two flags to every set, because "this is an instrument" turned out
to be two facts wearing one name:

``retired``
    The project does not measure on it any more. Enforced at dispatch by both
    rigs rather than remembered — a retired set is refused where a run record
    would be written, so no new number can be produced from one.

``trainable``
    Material from it may reach a training corpus. Read by
    ``tools/finetune/build_dataset.py``, which now refuses by *this* flag
    rather than by set membership.

They are independent in one direction and coupled in the other. A retired set
may be trainable (the five local sets, released by #240) or not (HumanEval+,
whose exposure cannot be established and which therefore must never be trained
on). A set that is **not** retired is never trainable, and :func:`declared`
refuses a declaration that says otherwise — measuring on what you trained on is
the #189 failure, and this file is where it stops being possible to write it
down.
