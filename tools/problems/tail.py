"""#212 — is the pool's hard tail a harder set, or a set that is harder to state?

#197's 14B TypeScript sweep covered 269 problems. The 80 admitted in batches
6-7 read markedly harder than the 189 the earlier 7B sweep had seen, and they
refused the parser ~4x as often (12.1% against 3.2%). Two readings were on the
table: the problems are harder, or the problems are *stated* worse and the
model's replies show it.

This instrument reads sweeps already on disk and separates three things the
headline rate confounds.

**Refusal shape.** A refusal code is not a diagnosis. ``incomplete-reply`` is
raised by :func:`mcgyvr.worker.reply.parse_reply` on the *stop reason*, before
a single fence is scanned, so it says the backend ran out of room and says
nothing about the text. ``no-fenced-block`` and ``ambiguous-blocks`` are the
codes that read the reply. :func:`refusal_shape` re-reads the pinned candidate
( keeps every one) and reports what the reply actually looks like —
how much prose precedes the first fence, how many fences there are, whether
the last one closes. A refusal set that is all stop-reason and no prose is an
output-cap finding; one with preambles and stray blocks is a reply-format
finding, and they belong to different issues.

**Size, held constant.** Reply length is what fills an output cap, and the
reference solution is the closest thing on disk to a lower bound on it. If the
newer batches simply contain bigger problems, then both their truncation rate
and their pass rate are predicted by size alone and batch membership adds
nothing. :func:`standardise` reweights one set's per-stratum rates to the
other's size distribution, so the two are compared at like size.

**A thin stratum is not evidence.** The reweighting is only as good as its
smallest cell, so :func:`standardise` is always reported with the bootstrap
interval from :func:`bootstrap_gap` and the per-stratum counts beside it. An
adjusted gap whose interval spans zero has not settled anything, and the point
estimate must not be quoted alone.

What no amount of re-reading can settle is whether the residual is difficulty:
that needs a second model over the same ids, which is a sweep, not an
analysis. ``--compare`` folds one in once it exists.

Usage::

    # the disk read: two sweeps, the newer one's extra tasks against its shared ones
    uv run --no-sync python tools/problems/tail.py \\
        --sweep records/measurements/pool-sweep-14b-2026-08-07/srv2-ts \\
        --baseline records/measurements/pool-sweep-2026-08-07/srv1-ts

    # with the confirming sweep of the same extra ids by the baseline's model
    uv run --no-sync python tools/problems/tail.py \\
        --sweep records/measurements/pool-sweep-14b-2026-08-07/srv2-ts \\
