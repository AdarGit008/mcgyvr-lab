"""#184 — pin every captured worker reply as the parser's golden corpus.

The corpus is the raw reply files the measurement rigs already write —
``candidates/`` under a breadth run, ``replies/`` under a bundle run — left
exactly where they landed. This tool does not copy or curate them; a curation
step is a step that gets skipped, and the population the
parser is measured against must be the one it actually faces. What this
writes is ``golden.json``: for each captured reply, the inputs the parser was
given (the stop reason from the run's own row, the output schema) and the
outcome it produced, so the whole set replays to the same verdicts or the
suite says which reply moved.

**Parse failures are pinned as gold, not excluded.** A reply the parser
refuses is the expected outcome for that input until someone improves the
parser and re-pins deliberately — the refused shapes are exactly the ones a
hand-authored fixture set is bounded away from (#174 is the receipt).

**Provenance is the join, and it must hold.** Every reply file is joined to
its row in the run's ``results.jsonl`` — that is where the stop reason lives,
and the parser's verdict depends on it. A reply with no row, or whose bytes
disagree with the sha the row recorded, is an error rather than an entry: a
fixture that cannot say where it came from is the thing this corpus exists
to replace.

**And provenance includes which instrument a run belongs to (#230).** This
corpus is walked by ``tools/finetune/build_dataset.py`` on its way to a
training set, so a run over a measurement set joins the training path at the
moment it lands. The guard belongs here, at the point of
entry, and it is a **stamp rather than an exclusion**: every run is classified
against ``tools/instruments.json`` and the verdict is written into the
document, so the training path can refuse what the parser corpus must keep.

Keeping it is not a compromise. The population the parser is measured against
must be the one it actually faces, and many of these replies came from ``d1``;
dropping them to protect a *different* consumer would curate the parser's corpus
down to the shapes that happen to be safe for fine-tuning. A stamp serves both
readers. What it must not be is optional: a run whose provenance cannot be
decided at all is a ``PinError``, not a clean run, because an unstamped run
reaches the builder as material.

Usage::

    # re-pin after a run added replies (the diff shows in git)
    uv run --no-sync python tools/replies/pin.py

    # recompute and compare against the pinned copy, changing nothing
    uv run --no-sync python tools/replies/pin.py --check

``tests/test_reply_corpus.py`` runs the same recomputation offline on every
suite run, so drift is caught without anyone remembering ``--check``.
