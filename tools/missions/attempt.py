"""The attempt: one :class:`~mcgyvr.route.Try` becomes a prompt, a dispatch, a
file, a gate run and a judgement — with the acceptance narrowed to the task's tests.

`#365 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/365>`_, item 3. Off-SURFACE:
the product pin (``tools/bench/product.py --check``) does not move for this file.

:func:`mcgyvr.escalate.escalate` takes ``attempt: Callable[[Try], Judgement[T]]``
and says of it: "it assembles a prompt, dispatches, applies, gates and calls
:func:`~mcgyvr.escalate.judge`. Keeping it a parameter is what lets every rule
here be asserted without a model, a backend or a sandbox." This module binds
that parameter, and it is built from the
shipped assembly and nothing else: :func:`~mcgyvr.worker.prompt.build_prompt`
renders, :func:`~mcgyvr.worker.reply.parse_reply` reads, the sandbox is E4's,
the scorer is :meth:`~mcgyvr.gate.Gate.run`, and the verdict is
:func:`~mcgyvr.escalate.judge`'s. A rung is never told where it runs: the Try's
rung name goes through the caller's dispatch, which is the seam
:mod:`mcgyvr.pool` draws.

**The defect this module prevents is an acceptance that is not the task's.** A
mission's base is the *parent* tree of a real commit (item 1) and its bar is the
*child's* test files — the ones the commit added. The adapter's conventional
test command (``pytest``, ``npm test``) runs the repository's whole suite, and on
a real repository that suite has three ways of lying about one attempt: a test
elsewhere in the tree that was already red at the parent (rejecting the worker
for a failure it did not cause), a suite that takes ten minutes for a change one
file wide (the timeout fires, and a kill is not a verdict), and a suite that
passes wholesale because the child's test was never on the path at all. So the
command is **narrowed to the task's test paths** — :func:`narrow_test_command`
appends them, and refuses by name a stack that offers no command, because
"no acceptance ran" must never read as "accepted". The child's tests are not in
the base by construction (item 1's leakage rule), so they are supplied here as
``acceptance_files`` and written into the sandbox **after** the change set is
computed: the gate lints, scopes and secret-scans the worker's diff alone, and
the acceptance command then finds the bar beside it. A test path in neither the
base nor ``acceptance_files`` is refused before a token is spent.

**What is the worker's and what is not, by verdict.** A reply the parser refuses
is the worker's: ``FAILED``, with the parser's own words as the retry notes, so
a second attempt on the same rung is told what shape was wrong. A reply whose
fenced block carries no code is the parser's named ``refusal`` (#174), and its
routing consequence is the one :mod:`mcgyvr.worker.reply` states — "escalate
rather than retrying this rung" — which in :mod:`mcgyvr.route`'s vocabulary is
``DECLINED``: the climb leaves the rung at once. A prompt that does not fit the
contract's ceiling is nobody's: :class:`PromptDoesNotFit` is raised, since a
preflight issue is an orchestration error and charging it to a rung would put a
failure on the ladder that no rung could clear. A dispatch that raises is not
caught, for :func:`~mcgyvr.route.climb`'s reason: a dead socket folded into a
judgement would report "this family cannot do the work" about a machine that
was never asked.

**Every try is traced, whatever it came to.** :func:`~mcgyvr.escalate.judge`
carries a value only on ``PASSED``, and the mission record (item 5) wants the
output beside the spec whether or not the gate accepted it — the owner's judge
reads output against the issue body, blind, and a failed attempt's file is
evidence too. So the callable is an :class:`Attempt` object whose
:attr:`~Attempt.trace` keeps, per Try, the completion, the parse outcome, the
gate result and the judgement; :meth:`Trace.as_dict` lays it out with every
pass/fail-shaped field under ``gate``, which is the one place the record lets a
verdict live.

**The acceptance imports the sandbox's sources, not the host's.**
:class:`MissionSandbox` is the default factory for that reason; its docstring
says how. A caller who binds another factory takes that property with it.

        """Write the file into a fresh sandbox, gate it, and bind what it read.

        The change set is computed **before** the acceptance files land, so
        the gate's own rungs see the worker's diff and nothing else; the
        narrowed command then runs with the child's tests beside the change.

        **The binding is minted here because here is the only place it can be.**
        This sandbox is opened per try and torn down when the ``with`` closes —
        ``Sandbox.__exit__`` removes the workspace tree outright — so by the time
        ``escalate`` returns a ``Delivered`` there is no tree anywhere holding
        the accepted bytes. :meth:`~mcgyvr.deliver.Accepted.read` takes the bytes off
        the workspace the verdict was reached over, one line after it was
        reached and while it still exists.

        ``None`` on a rejected verdict, and deliberately: an ``Accepted`` is a
        binding between bytes and an *acceptance*, so minting one for a rejection
        would make the type mean "some bytes and some verdict" and give a caller
        something to mistake for a licence to write.

    are those paths' contents when the base does not hold them, which for a
    mission is always (:func:`acceptance_files_from` reads them off the child
    commit). ``dispatch`` is how a Try reaches its rung — :func:`dispatch_via`

    the narrowed command (the schema requires one for a model-run type, so the
    caller declares :func:`acceptance_for`'s answer and nothing else).
    ``quality_sensitive`` defaults to ``True`` because a mission's output is
    read as a measurement of the pool (CAV-01: the caveated path refuses
    rather than answering). ``sandbox_factory`` defaults to
    :class:`MissionSandbox` so the acceptance imports the sandbox's sources
