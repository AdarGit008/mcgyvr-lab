"""The mission runner: one admitted commit through the orchestrator, on a local pool.

`#365 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/365>`_ item 4, riding the
owner's decisions recorded on the issue: admission is code+test commits from
Adar's own repos, a multi-file commit stays one task and ``decompose`` owns the
split, **no API fallback**, and the judge is output beside issue body at the
month's review. This module is the loop those decisions describe, and nothing
in it is new product surface: every step is a call into ``src/mcgyvr`` —
:func:`~mcgyvr.orchestrator.repo.attach`,
:func:`~mcgyvr.orchestrator.index.build_index`,
:func:`~mcgyvr.orchestrator.decompose.decompose`,
:func:`~mcgyvr.escalate.escalate` — strung together off-SURFACE.

**The defect this prevents is a run that answers a different question than the
one asked.** The question is whether the *local* pool reaches a commit's own
tests from its issue body. A ladder with a credentialed rung would let a task
that the local rungs cannot do climb to an API and come back accepted, and the
record would then read as a local result. :func:`require_local_only` refuses
that config **before** anything is dispatched, naming every source that requires
a credential and where it is bound — so the refusal is a fact about the config
file, not about what a task happened to reach. :attr:`Config.is_local_only`
looks at the ladder alone; this looks at every declared source, because the
orchestrator and verifier roles dispatch too.

**The worktree stays the parent; the acceptance travels by content.** Item 1
checks out the parent tree and keeps the child's tests off disk (its leakage
rule), and item 3 writes them into each sandbox *after* the change set is
computed, so the gate never attributes someone else's test file to the worker
(``changeset.py`` reads an untracked file as worker-added). This runner reads
them once off the child commit through item 3's ``acceptance_files_from`` and
hands them to every attempt. Only after the last gate has run are they written
beside the delivered files, for the one whole-tree run of the narrowed command
whose exit status the record carries — and that run, like every per-try
acceptance, goes through E4's :class:`~mcgyvr.sandbox.tempdir.TempDirSandbox`:
a command read off someone else's commit runs on an archived copy with the
credential variables filtered, never in the canonical clone's worktree with the
host environment. The assembled worktree is what the record was built from,
and :func:`main` releases it from the clone once the record is written unless
``--keep-worktree`` asks to inspect it.

**Siblings are loaded at call time, by path.** ``tasks``, ``propose``,
``attempt`` and ``record`` are items 1, 2, 3 and 5. A sibling that is missing
is a named refusal (:class:`SiblingMissing`); a sibling whose factory wants
something this runner does not hold is another (:class:`SiblingMismatch`),
naming the parameter — never a positional guess.

**The bar is declared by the runner, not named by the model.** The catalog's
command-needing evidence is left for a proposer to fill, and in a mission the
command is not the model's to invent: it is the child's tests, narrowed. Item
2's proposals pass through :class:`_DeclaringProposer`, which fills the slot
each type needs with item 3's ``acceptance_for`` — the same computation
``make_attempt`` runs — so the declared command and the one that runs cannot
disagree.

**Each delivery is committed before the next climb.** Item 3 populates every
try's sandbox with ``git archive HEAD`` of the worktree, so a file that only
sits uncommitted beside it is invisible to the next contract's base: on a
multi-contract task the second contract would be attempted against the parent
tree as if the first had never delivered. So after each ``Delivered`` the file
is delivered through :func:`mcgyvr.deliver.deliver` — the one seam in the
project that commits, which re-runs the gate over the bytes on disk inside the
repository lock before staging — and the record lists the sha each contract
moved HEAD to (``output.head``). A delivery it refuses is recorded at stage
``deliver`` rather than counted as one: a refusal is not a completion. The
commits belong to the
mission worktree; once it is released they dangle in the canonical clone until
it prunes, which is the cost of the base being a real tree rather than a copy.

**The record carries no verdict.** Everything pass/fail-shaped lives under
``output.gate``: the whole-tree run's exit status (``gate.whole``) and, per
contract, the climb's verdicts and item 3's trace of every try
(``gate.contracts``). ``output.outcomes`` carries only the rule that ended each
climb (:class:`~mcgyvr.escalate.Outcome`) and its counts; ``verdict`` anywhere
else is the review's word and item 5 refuses it on read. A halted escalation is
recorded the same way — the unrecoverable is recorded, not skipped.
So is everything that stopped a contract before, during or after its climb:
``output.attempt_refusals`` names each one with its stage — a bar the proposer
could not declare (``declare``), an attempt item 3 refused to assemble
(``assemble``), a ``RunnerError`` that escaped ``escalate`` (``dispatch``, with
the last rung dispatched), or a delivery :mod:`mcgyvr.deliver` refused or raised on
(``deliver``). An attempt that raises mid-climb is ``escalate``'s
``Outcome.ERROR``, recorded under ``output.outcomes``.
