"""The mission record — output beside spec, and no verdict the gate did not write.

#365 item 5, off-SURFACE (``tools/missions/`` is not in ``product.SURFACE``).
Rides the owner's 2026-08-25 decision on #365: real commits become the tasks,
and **judging output against the issue body happens blind, at the month's
review** — not on the lane, not in code, not in the record.

**The defect this prevents.** A record that carries a verdict beside its output
is read as judged. Nothing distinguishes a ``"verdict": "good"`` a person typed
after a glance from one a gate computed, and once the field is on disk it is
quoted, tallied and believed. The first reviewer to open sixty of
these a month from now must find sixty outputs and sixty specs and nothing that
tells them what to think. So the record has exactly one place a pass/fail may
appear — ``output.gate``, the gate's own result, which is a measurement of the
sandbox and not an opinion of the work — and :func:`read` refuses the record
outright when a verdict-shaped name appears anywhere else. The refusal is by
name and file (:class:`VerdictNotTheGates`), so the field that crept in is the
first thing on the screen.

**Why the check is on the reader and not only the writer.** :func:`write` is one
of many ways bytes reach ``task.json``; an editor is another. A writer-side
guard proves the record was clean when written, and the property the review
needs is that it is clean when *read*. Both sides run the same walk.

**Why side by side.** ``task.json`` is the record; ``spec.md`` and
``output/<path>`` are the same content laid out for a person — a spec to read
and files to open in an editor, beside each other, without a JSON decoder in
between. Two copies can drift, so :func:`read` refuses when the human-readable
copy disagrees with the record (:class:`RecordDriftError`): the on-disk files are
a view, and a view that says something the record does not is a second record.

**What the reader does not check.** ``identity`` is run.json-shaped and
``intent`` is a ``run-header/1`` — each has its own closed spine
(``identity.RECORDED``, ``headers.KEYS``) and its own reader. This module checks
the record's own top level and the whole ``output`` tree except ``output.gate``.
