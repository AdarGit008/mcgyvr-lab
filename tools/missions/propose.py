"""The live proposer — a reply is proposals or a recorded refusal, never an exception.

`#365 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/365>`_, item 2. Off-SURFACE:
the product pin (``tools/bench/product.py --check``) does not move for this file.

:func:`mcgyvr.orchestrator.decompose.decompose` takes a :data:`Proposer`. Here
a real commit is the task, the spec is its issue body, and the pool
rung is asked what units of work it would emit. The defect this module
prevents is the obvious one: **a model's
reply is text, and text that is not proposals must become a record rather
than a traceback.** A campaign over the ``tasks_admitted`` rows with
a spec cannot stop on the first rung that answers in prose, and it must not
lose the fact that it did — the prose *is* the finding.

Three rules, each one a function below.

1. *The reply is read as a document, in a fixed order, and nothing else is
   tried.* :func:`parse_proposals` accepts ``{"proposals": [...]}``, a bare
   JSON list, or a single ```` ```json ```` fenced block inside prose — the
   three shapes a model told to answer in JSON actually produces. Anything
   else is a :class:`~mcgyvr.orchestrator.decompose.Refusal` whose ``reason``
   says which shape was seen. There is no fourth attempt that scrapes a path
   out of prose: a proposal recovered by guessing would look like a plan.
2. *An item is a :class:`~mcgyvr.orchestrator.decompose.Proposal` or the
   whole reply is refused.* The fields are the dataclass's own, read off it
   rather than copied here, so this module cannot drift from the seam it
   feeds. A missing required field, a wrong type, or a key ``Proposal`` does
   not have refuses the reply **by name** — the last case on purpose, because
   the key a model invents is exactly the one the seam exists to keep out
   (``signature``, ``content``). Dropping it silently would permit
   the sixth field the guard did not name. One bad item refuses the reply,
   not the item: a list with a hole in it is not the plan the model stated.
3. *The prompt is a constant, so the record can hash it.* :data:`SYSTEM` and
   :data:`USER` are module constants and :func:`prompt_digest` is their
   digest; a record that names which prompt produced its proposals is
   comparable across a month's runs, and one that does not is not.

**Where the exception classes are.** Every refusal is a named exception with
the offending thing in its message — :class:`ReplyNotJSONError`,
:class:`ReplyShapeError`, :class:`ProposalFieldError` — but none crosses
:func:`parse_proposals`: it catches its own and returns the ``Refusal``. The
names exist so the *cause* is typed rather than a string prefix, and so a
caller that wants to raise can call :func:`read_proposals` instead.

**What a transport failure is not.** :class:`LiveProposer` records a reply
that is not proposals; it does not swallow a rung that did not reply.
:class:`~mcgyvr.runner.RunnerError` propagates, because "the model answered
in prose" and "srv2 was down" are different findings and a refusal that
folded them together would be the finding nobody could read.
