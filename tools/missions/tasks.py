"""A ``tasks_admitted`` row becomes a task: the parent tree on disk, the spec beside it.

#365 flips the tables — real commits from Adar's own repositories are the tasks
the orchestrator is run against, and the owner's admission rule is the view
``tasks_admitted`` in ``~/claude/session-mine/sessions.sqlite``. The corpus
lives outside every repo on purpose: nothing here is a fixture, nothing here is
checked in, and this module opens the database read-only.

**The defect this module prevents is leakage.** A row names the *child* commit
— the one that carries the code and the test — but the task is its *parent*:
the tree as it stood before the work, with the child's test absent, because
that test is the acceptance and not the base. Checking out the child sha would
hand the pool the answer in its own working tree, and every acceptance figure
downstream would be a figure about nothing. So :func:`checkout` takes the first
parent, and only the first parent (the view excludes merges; a second parent is
never the base), and the test that turns this module green asserts the child's
test is not on disk.

**Two refusals are ours, not git's.** A parent sha that the canonical clone
cannot see — the view admits recovered commits (``reachable=0``) whose objects
were found in the store but belong to no ref, and clones move — is checked with
``git cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}`` *before* ``git worktree add`` runs, so the
exception names the sha, the clone, and the child it was the base of, rather
than surfacing git's ``fatal: invalid reference``. A root commit has no base
tree and is refused at :meth:`Task.from_row`, again by sha. Each refusal is a
named exception with the offending thing in its message.

The judge's reference is the issue body (owner decision on #365: output versus
issue body, blind), so ``spec`` is the issue text and ``pr_spec`` is carried
separately and never substituted for it. :func:`iter_tasks` yields the rows
with a spec by default; a task with none is loadable by sha but is not a
mission.
