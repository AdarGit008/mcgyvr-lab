"""#144 — the bundle-size condition ladder, over a JS/TS task set or a Python one.

**Both arms are retired (#240).** Every sweep invocation is refused;
``--selftest`` and ``--summarise-only`` still run.

**The ladder separates two questions.** Whether a bundle helps at all is c0
against c1/c2; whether ``MAX_BUNDLE_BYTES`` is the right ceiling for the
language is c2 against c3.

**The conditions differ only in the system prompt.** The user message is
:func:`~mcgyvr.worker.prompt.render_user_message` over the contract's
``worker_view()`` in every condition. c0 sends no system prompt at all.

**c2 is the shipped bundle, byte for byte, and this refuses to run if it is
not.** That is the property that makes a result quotable about
``prompts/javascript.md`` rather than about a file that resembles it — the same
discipline that keeps ``prompts/python.md`` equal to the measured ``c2.md``.
:func:`check_c2_is_the_shipped_bundle` holds it.

**Dispatch is mcgyvr's own.** :class:`~mcgyvr.runner.Request` through
:func:`~mcgyvr.runner.runner_for`, so the measurement runs through the code that
ships rather than a benchmark's private HTTP client — including the cap, the
refusal to send stop sequences, and truncation read from the
backend's own stop reason. Replies are parsed by
:func:`~mcgyvr.worker.reply.parse_reply` with that real stop reason, so a reply
this project would refuse is scored as a failure here too, by its refusal code.
``quality_sensitive=True`` marks every request: this output is read as a
measurement of the model, so a caveated source may not serve it.

**Every reply is kept.** Raw reply text lands in ``replies/`` beside the rows,
parseable or refused, first attempt and remediation retry alike (#184).

**Acceptance is the contract's, executed, never inspected.** Each task declares
``acceptance: ["node accept.mjs"]``; the runner writes the worker's file as
``solution.ts`` beside a copy of ``accept.mjs`` in a fresh temp directory and
runs the declared command there. Node 24 executes TypeScript directly by
stripping types, so a task needs no toolchain, no install and no network.

**--language selects which arm runs (#167).** The Python arm is a Python task
set ported to mcgyvr contracts in ``python/tasks/``, run through this same
instrument — so that against the JS/TS arm, language is the only thing that
differs. Its conditions are the vendored files themselves, under
``records/evidence/local-ai-2026-08-02/``, and its ``c2`` is
``src/mcgyvr/prompts/python.md`` byte for byte just as the JS/TS ``c2`` is
``javascript.md``.

**--selftest is a precondition, not a convenience.** Every reference solution is
run against its own acceptance script; the experiment is invalid unless that is
100% green. It needs no worker and no endpoint, so the task set can be verified
on a machine that cannot run the sweep.

**The worker is configuration, not part of the experiment.** Which endpoint
serves the model is a fact about somebody's machine — a hostname, a tunnel port,
the name of a variable holding a key — so it lives in a git-ignored
``worker.local.json`` beside this script rather than in a command line that has
to be retyped correctly every time. Flags beat the file. What *is* part of the
experiment is that the reader can tell which worker produced a number, so a
sweep writes ``run.json`` next to its rows and refuses to resume into a
directory measured on a different one.

Usage::

    # verify the task set (no worker needed)
    uv run --no-sync python tools/bundle/measure.py --selftest

    # the table, from rows already collected
    uv run --no-sync python tools/bundle/measure.py --out <dir> --summarise-only
