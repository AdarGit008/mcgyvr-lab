"""Build the #189 pilot's training set from the worker-reply corpus.

The corpus (`records/corpora/worker-replies/golden.json`) pins every
captured reply with its sha and its parse verdict; each run's `results.jsonl`
records whether the checker passed the reply. This tool joins the two and emits
chat-format training examples for exactly the rows that are **verified passes**:
the reply parsed, the checker accepted it, and the bytes on disk still match the
pinned sha.

The prompt is not stored anywhere — the corpus keeps only what the
parser reads — so it is **rebuilt** through the same assembly the rigs used:
:func:`mcgyvr.worker.prompt.build_prompt` over the tier's contracts. Each run
pinned ``sha256(prompt.system)`` as ``bundle_sha256`` at capture time; the
rebuild recomputes it and refuses to emit a run whose prompt no longer matches.
A training pair whose prompt is not the prompt the reply actually answered is
worse than a missing one.

**No example may come from a set the declaration does not mark trainable
(#230, #240).** ``d1`` *is* ``tools/bundle/tasks/`` byte for byte — half the
floor instrument. The train/val split partitions what is already drawn and has
no concept of a set that must not be drawn from at all.

So two checks read one declaration:

1. the run's stamp in ``golden.json``, written by ``tools/replies/pin.py`` at
   the point of entry;
2. an independent classification of the same run against
   ``tools/instruments.json``, made here and now.

They must agree on *which sets* a run belongs to, and **disagreement between
them is fatal** rather than resolved in the permissive direction: a corpus
whose stamps predate the current declaration is a corpus that would quietly
readmit whatever was declared since. The instrument is a *problem*, not a
language, so a set's membership carries both arms of a paired id — protecting
only the trained-on language is not protection.

Set membership is not the refusal; ``trainable`` is. #240 retired all five local
sets and released them, on the argument that a set nobody will measure on again
cannot be contaminated by training on it — so their material is drawn, and the
manifest records that it was released rather than pretending it was never an
instrument. ``humaneval-plus`` is retired and **never** trainable, and is
refused by name here for as long as it is declared. That asymmetry is the point
of two flags: one flag would either strand the replies the local sets account
for or release material that must never be released.

Curation, all deterministic:

- dedup by reply sha across the whole set — the same solution drawn twice is
  one example;
- per-``(problem, language)`` cap (``--cap``, default 40), selected round-robin
  across models so no single model's phrasing dominates — where a *problem* is
  its id **and the set it came from**, because ``t01`` names one problem in
  ``d1`` and a different one in ``d2`` and #240 released both;
- validation split by problem (``--split-by``, default ``problem``), so both
  language arms of a problem land on the same side.

**Two senses of "arm" meet in this file, and they are not the same thing.** The
``arm`` field in a run's ``results.jsonl`` — and the ``arm`` group of a
candidate path — is the *sampling* arm (``greedy``, ``t07``…): how the reply
was drawn. It is called ``sample`` throughout this module. #197's arm is the
*language* (``jsts``/``python``): two contracts, one problem id, one directory
name in each of ``tools/problems/tasks/ts`` and ``…/py``. It is called
``language`` here, and it is read off the resolved contract rather than guessed
from the tier name.

Why the cap and the split key on those things:

- A problem's two language arms are separate training material — separate
  prompts, separate solutions — so they get separate cap budgets. Keyed on the
  bare problem id (as this tool did before #197 landed paired arms) one arm
  could consume the whole cap and the other contribute nothing. Keyed on the
  *tier* instead, the same contract served by two tiers of one language would
  get two budgets, which is the opposite error.
- A problem's two language arms are near-translations of each other. Bucketing
  the split per reply put one arm in train and its pair in val for roughly 18%
  of problems, so val measured recall of a solution already seen in the other
  language. Holding out the *problem* is what makes val a generalisation
  measure — the property #113's held-out set exists for.
