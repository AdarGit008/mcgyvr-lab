"""#117 — the token estimator's error against real tokenizers.

``estimate_tokens`` (``orchestrator/read.py``) is four characters per token and
says so. The exploration budget charges a region before reading it, the
decomposer sizes ``context.max_input_tokens`` off ``worker_view()``, and
``check_prompt_fits`` enforces a hard cap over the assembled prompt.
A hard cap enforced by an unquantified proxy either over-prunes a prompt that
would have fit or admits one the backend rejects, and there is no way to tell
which is happening. This measures which.

**The corpus is captured, not constructed.** #117 says to measure "through the
injectable ``estimate`` seam — the seam exists for exactly this", and that is
literally what happens here: :class:`Recorder` is passed to the real
:func:`~mcgyvr.orchestrator.read.explore` as its ``estimate``, so every string
measured is a string production actually asked the estimator to count, produced
by the real region planner over real repositories. Nothing here reimplements a
window, and no text is hand-picked.

**What is not measured.** Assembled worker prompts. The corpus is read regions
and worker-view documents, so the band is a band over *content*; the fixed
wrapper :func:`~mcgyvr.worker.prompt.build_prompt` adds is unmeasured here.

**Queries are derived, not chosen.** A hand-picked query list would be a corpus
decision nobody could recheck. Each frame is queried with its own exported
symbol names, sorted for determinism and capped — with the cap reported, because
a silent cap reads as "everything was measured".

**No tokenizer is a runtime dependency and no model is called.** ``tokenizers``
lives in the ``measure`` dependency group, which is not a default group, so
``make setup`` and CI never install it. A tokenizer is a vocabulary file; it is
downloaded from the model's own repository and cached, and nothing is generated.
