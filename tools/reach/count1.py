**Measured at each change's own commit, not once per frame.** A line number
only means something in the tree that contains it, and the rung's question is
posed at the moment a change is proposed: these checks, against this tree, do
they reach what this change added? Running the suite once at the frame's tip and
mapping old line numbers forward would answer a different question and would put
a line-tracking heuristic between the corpus and the number. So the suite runs
77 times, which the frames make affordable — under a minute of container time
per commit for all three.

**Four outcomes per added line, not two.** An added line is *reached* if the
instrument saw it execute, *unreached* if the instrument considered it
executable and it never ran, *non-executable* if it is a blank line, a comment
or something the instrument excludes, and *not reported* if its file never
appeared in the report at all. Folding the last two into "unreached" is what
turns this measurement into a bigger, wronger number: a comment was never going
to execute, and counting it as unreached inflates the gap that #123 is being
sized against. The headline is therefore over executable added lines, and the
remainder is printed beside it rather than absorbed.

**A suite that fails still executed lines.** Exit status is recorded per commit
and reported, but a non-zero suite is not silently dropped: the question is what
the declared check *ran*, and a check with one failing test ran nearly all of it.
What is excluded — loudly, with a reason — is a commit that produced no report at
all, because there the instrument, not the repository, is what failed.
