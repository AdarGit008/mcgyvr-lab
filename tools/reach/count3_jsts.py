"""Count 3, the JS/TypeScript half — a candidate resolver over code that shipped.

    python tools/reach/count3_jsts.py --run
    python tools/reach/count3_jsts.py --summarise

``count3.py`` measures a candidate resolver for the Python frames. This is the
JS/TS measurement (#133), over the third frame of the same pinned corpus.

**The candidate is the TypeScript compiler, driven through its own API** —
``ts.createProgram`` followed by ``getSemanticDiagnostics``, with the verdict
read off the diagnostic code. It is here because the survey found nothing
lighter that answers the question at all; what was rejected and why is in
``mcgyvr-lab/records/measurements/reach-jsts-2026-08-03/README.md``. It is
emphatically not a like-for-like swap for ghostcall: ghostcall is stdlib-only
files resolving against a live interpreter, and this is a full type-checker
resolving against a type graph. That difference is the finding, not an
inconvenience in reporting it.

**Counted the same way as Counts 1-3** — same corpus, per change, restricted to
the lines the change added, with the whole-file rate recorded beside it. A flag
on a line the change did not touch is not a verdict the rung would render.

**Why a flag counts as a false positive, and the limit of that.** Identical to
``count3.py``: every measured file shipped through a declared, human-gated check,
so a flag on it is a *presumptive* false positive, and each one is written out
with its path and line so the presumption can be checked by hand.

**The denominator does not transfer, and pretending it does would be the error.**
The Python count's denominator is *resolved call chains*, because ghostcall
resolves calls. A
TypeScript diagnostic lands on any expression — a type reference, a property
access in a type position, an identifier in a declaration — and immer's accepted
changes are heavily type-level, so several of them contain no call expression at
all. Three denominators are therefore recorded per change (call expressions,
property accesses, identifiers), and the rate is reported against each rather
than against one picked after the fact.

**Three arms, because "what it needs to run" is a number here, not an adjective.**
ghostcall's cost was established by reading ``check()``; this candidate's cost has
to be measured, because the whole question is what happens to its verdicts when
the environment is not fully provisioned:

- ``target-ts`` — the frame's own ``node_modules`` installed, resolving with the
  frame's own ``typescript``. Both the environment and the checker are the
  target's.
- ``staged-ts`` — the frame's ``node_modules`` installed, resolving with a
  version-pinned ``typescript`` staged into the container. The environment is
  the target's, the checker is ours. This is the arm that tests version drift.
- ``bare`` — no ``node_modules`` at all, staged checker. This is what a rung that
  declined to provision the target would actually see.

**The environment/verdict split is kept, because it is the difference between a
wrong rung and a vacuous one.** ``count3.py`` counts ``module_missing``
separately from ``hallucinated`` on the grounds that failing to import a root is
an environment outcome. TypeScript spends distinct codes on the same
distinction — 2307 and 2580 name a missing module or a missing ``@types``
package, while 2339 and 2304 assert that a named thing does not exist — so the
same split is available here and is applied at :data:`EXISTENCE` /
:data:`ENVIRONMENT`. The table is not taken from documentation: the driver
extracts each code's message template from the bytes of the resolver it loaded,
and writes it beside the rows.
