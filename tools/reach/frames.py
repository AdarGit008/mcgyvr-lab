"""Shared machinery for #129's three counts over the pinned reach corpus.

``enumerate.py`` fixed the denominator; this fixes how the numerators are
produced. Three things are shared and none of them are obvious, so they live
here rather than being written three times:

**Added lines, not added-line counts.** ``corpus.json`` stores how many source
lines each change added, which was all Count 2 and the corpus check needed. The
reach count needs *which* lines, because a line number is only meaningful in the
tree that contains it. :func:`added_lines` recomputes them from the same diff
``enumerate.py`` counted, and Count 1 asserts the recomputed total equals
the pinned one — that assertion is what makes "re-runs to the same number" a
property of the code rather than a hope.

**A container, always.** Target code runs inside a container: the
resolver Count 3 measures imports the target's own modules, and Count 1 runs
the target's test suite, which is arbitrary code by construction. Nothing here
runs a target's code on the host. Host-side work is git metadata only, which is
the same line ``enumerate.py`` draws.

**The declared check is the repository's, not ours.** Each frame's command comes
from ``corpus.json``'s ``declared_check``, so the measurement runs what the
repository declared rather than what a detector guessed about it. That is why
this does not reuse :mod:`mcgyvr.sandbox`: ``detect_stack`` infers an install
command from the manifests it finds, and substituting mcgyvr's inference for the
repository's own declaration is the error to avoid. The sandbox
is also built around a per-task workspace with a git base commit to diff a
worker's change against, and there is no worker here. What is borrowed is its
discipline — a per-frame container, no host environment inherited, torn down
after — not its code.
