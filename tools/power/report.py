"""What each instrument this repository owns can actually resolve.

Reads the checked-in measurement records, derives the discordance structure of
every paired contrast in them, and reports the effect each one could have
detected. Nothing here is hand-entered: every figure in the tables is
recomputed by ``python tools/power/report.py`` from ``records/measurements/``,
so a re-run is the check.

Two distinct questions, and the report answers both because they get confused:

*Responsiveness* — over a whole condition matrix, how many tasks ever change
verdict at all. This is the count of condition-insensitive tasks, stated the
other way up.

*Discordance* — for one contrast, how many tasks differ between exactly two
conditions. This is what carries the power, and it is smaller.
