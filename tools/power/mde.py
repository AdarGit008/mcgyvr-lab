"""Paired-design power arithmetic for the floor bench.

Every arm on the bench compares two conditions over the *same*
tasks, so the test is McNemar's and the quantity that carries the power is not
the task count. It is the number of tasks whose verdict actually *differs*
between the two conditions — the discordant pairs. Tasks that pass under both,
or fail under both, contribute exactly nothing: they are not weak evidence of a
small effect, they are absent from the test statistic.

That is why nominal *n* is the wrong denominator for sizing an instrument, and
why the folk arithmetic "halving the detectable effect costs 4x the tasks" is
optimistic by however far the discordance rate sits below 1.

Two rates, kept distinct throughout:

``psi``    the **discordance rate** — P(a task's verdict differs between the two
           conditions). Estimated per *contrast*, and a property of the
           (instrument, lever) pair, never of the task set alone.
``delta``  the **net effect** — P(fail->pass) - P(pass->fail), which is what a
           pass-rate table reports as a difference.

``psi >= |delta|`` always, and the gap between them is churn: tasks that flip in
both directions and cancel in the headline number while still costing power.

Small-*n* honesty
-----------------
The textbook normal approximation is not usable at the sizes this repository
owns. Under the exact conditional test a contrast with ``m`` discordant pairs has
a best-case two-sided p of ``2 / 2**m``, so **m >= 6 is a hard floor**: below it
no effect of any magnitude reaches p < 0.05, and an asymptotic formula will
quote a minimum detectable effect anyway. Everything here respects that wall.
