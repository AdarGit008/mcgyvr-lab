"""A reviewer's table over the live journal — folded and joined, never the journal.

The journal ``mcgyvr run`` writes (under the config's ``journal.dir``, or
``--record DIR``) is append-only
for two reasons :mod:`mcgyvr.telemetry` states — several orchestrators can write
one directory, and a crash mid-write loses one line — and both hold only as
long as nothing else opens a ``.jsonl`` for writing. A reviewer wants the
opposite shape: one row per attempt with its final outcome already applied and
the prompt and the reply beside it as text, in something that takes a
``WHERE``. This tool builds that shape as a separate artifact,
``DIR/index.sqlite``, and leaves the journal exactly as it found it — the
``.jsonl`` files are opened read-only and are byte-identical before and after.

**Rebuilt from scratch, every run.** An index that updated in place would need
to know which lines it had already seen, which is state kept beside a journal
that keeps none, and the first orchestrator to append after a partial build
would leave rows the index silently lacked. Folding a directory of ``.jsonl``
is cheap: the index is a cache of ``telemetry.fold``, and a cache that is
rebuilt cannot be stale. Running it twice yields the same rows.

**One row per folded attempt.** ``fold`` applies corrections latest-wins in
file order and returns orphan corrections — a correction naming no attempt —
verbatim after the attempts. Here a correction is a column (``outcome``,
``detail``, ``applied_by`` — the winning verdict, its words and the writer who
gave it) and not a row, and an orphan is dropped: ``fold`` surfaces it for
a reader of the journal, but it is not an attempt, and a table of attempts
that listed it would count a mistake as a dispatch.

**The blobs are joined as text, not as names.** ``prompt_text`` and
``reply_text`` are the bytes of ``DIR/blobs/<sha>``, decoded; the digests stay
beside them so a row can still be checked against the store. A blob that is
missing is ``NULL``, never ``""`` — an empty reply is a blob of zero bytes
with a name, and the two must not read the same.

**Every column is nullable**, because every key on a journal row is optional:
``reply_sha256`` is absent on an attempt that raised, ``round`` and
``product_sha256`` are absent outside a checkout, ``outcome`` is absent until
someone corrects. ``NULL`` is the SQL spelling of absent-is-honest.

**``off_round`` is the reader's verdict, and the one derived column.** A row
written inside the checkout carries ``round`` and ``product_sha256`` — the
open round's id and the digest of the tree that dispatched — and the digest is
the tree's whether or not that tree was the round's: :mod:`mcgyvr.telemetry`
records off-round rather than refusing it, so the journal does not go dark on
the days the product is changing, and leaves the flagging to the reader. This
is the reader. ``off_round`` is ``0`` when the row's digest is the one
``tools/bench/rounds.json`` pins for the row's round, ``1`` when it differs,
and ``NULL`` when nothing can be said — the row has no round (an install that
is not this checkout) or names one the file has never opened. Never ``0`` for
a digest nobody can check: a comparison that did not happen is not one that
passed. It is judged at build time against the rounds file of the checkout
that builds, which is one more reason the index is rebuilt rather than
updated — a round opened after a row was written is found by the next build.
