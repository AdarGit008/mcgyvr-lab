"""Read what the product dispatched: the prompt, the reply and how it landed.

The whole reason the live journal keeps text (:mod:`mcgyvr.telemetry`, *the
text is kept*) is that someone can read what a rung was asked and what it
answered and judge whether the answer was any good — a number says a rung
answered, and only the prompt beside the reply says whether it should have
been accepted. This is that reader: one prompt/reply/outcome triple per
matching attempt, straight out of the journal directory — the ``*.jsonl``
files folded and the blobs joined by hash — with no index built first,
because a review must not depend on a second artifact being up to date.

**The filter is the point as much as the printing.** A reviewer asking for
the rejected attempts who is handed the accepted ones too has to redo the
filter by eye over prompts that run to pages, and a review nobody can narrow
is a review nobody runs. ``--outcome`` keeps the attempts whose *folded*
outcome — the latest correction, as ``fold`` decides — is the word given;
``--orchestrator`` keeps one writer's. An attempt nobody has corrected has no
outcome and is printed and filtered as ``uncorrected``, so the word on the
screen is the word that selects it.

**A verdict somebody else gave is printed with its author.** ``fold`` carries
``applied_by`` — the writer of the correction that won — beside the outcome it
belongs to, and under §9 that need not be the orchestrator that ran the
attempt. So an outcome applied by another writer prints as ``outcome=rejected
(applied by review)``, and one applied by the row's own runner prints as the
outcome alone: every one of mcgyvr's ``correct()`` call sites passes the
recording orchestrator, so the byline would otherwise repeat the row's own
``orchestrator=`` on every line of every journal the product writes.

**Absent is printed as absent.** A raised attempt has no reply and says so
with its error; a blob the row names and the store lacks is reported as
missing. Neither is printed as an empty reply, which is a thing a model can
actually produce.

**The header says which product answered.** A row written inside the checkout
names its ``round`` and the digest of the tree that dispatched, and
:mod:`mcgyvr.telemetry` records an off-round tree rather than refusing it —
the reader flags it. So each header carries one word from ``index.off_round``:
``on-round``, ``off-round``, or ``round-unknown`` for a row with no round to
check against or one the rounds file never opened. A reviewer judging a reply
is judging a product revision, and the word says which one it was.
