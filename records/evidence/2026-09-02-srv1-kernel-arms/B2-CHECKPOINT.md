# B2's checkpoint, and what `--linear-backend` actually is in v0.26.0

Off-rig research, 2026-09-01. Resolves the first two `Blockers` in
`lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:132-139`. Nothing here was measured on srv1; every claim
cites a URL or a repo path, and what could not be checked is marked
**UNVERIFIED**.

---

## Headline

1. `--linear-backend` **exists** in `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.26.0`, and `exllama` is
   one of its 20 accepted values. The August refusal was not the flag failing to
   parse — it was the kernel refusing the *quant type* of an AWQ checkpoint.
2. The doc's proposed fallback, `--quantization gptq` vs `--quantization
   gptq_marlin`, **does not name two kernels in v0.26.0**. Both strings resolve
   to the same config class. That contrast is invalid here.
3. So B2 keeps `--linear-backend exllama`, and B1 becomes `--linear-backend
   marlin` on the same checkpoint — one flag, one variable, one artifact.
4. The checkpoint should be **`Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4`**.

## (B) `--linear-backend` in v0.26.0

### The flag exists, and `exllama` is a legal value

Already captured in this repo, from the image itself:
`records/evidence/2026-08-24-knob-surface/declared-vllm-ffb2d59b1c05.json`,
flag index 255 (`vllm/vllm-openai@sha256:ffb2d59b1c059a5bd8d781320c9f5189de8293693b7d95da54befddaa54abf52`):

```
--linear-backend   shape=choice   default=auto
choices = [aiter, auto, conch, cutlass, deep_gemm, emulation, exllama, fbgemm,
           flashinfer_b12x, flashinfer_cudnn, flashinfer_cutedsl,
           flashinfer_cutlass, flashinfer_trtllm, humming, machete, marlin,
           torch, triton, xpu, xpu_woq]
```

Every startup log in `records/` also prints the resolved value, e.g.
`records/evidence/2026-08-24-resolved-config/srv2-startup.log:16` —
`kernel_config=KernelConfig(..., moe_backend='auto', linear_backend='auto')`.

### How the flag is honoured

`vllm/model_executor/kernels/linear/__init__.py` @ `v0.26.0`:

- `_get_linear_backend()` reads `config.kernel_config.linear_backend` (default
  `"auto"`).
- `_LINEAR_BACKEND_KERNEL_MAP` maps `"exllama" -> {ExllamaLinearKernel}`. The
  comment is explicit: *"When a user sets `--linear-backend <name>`, only kernels
  in the corresponding set are considered candidates. If none can implement the
  layer config, an error is raised to respect the user's explicit intent."*
- `_POSSIBLE_KERNELS[PlatformEnum.CUDA]`, in priority order, is
  `[CutlassW4A8, Machete, AllSpark, Marlin, Conch, Exllama, TritonW4A16,
  Humming]`. So under `auto` on sm75 the winner is **Marlin** — B1's premise is
  correct — and `exllama` is only ever reached by naming it.
- The chooser raises `ValueError("Failed to find a kernel that can implement the
  WNA16 linear layer. Reasons: \n" + ...)`. That is verbatim the string srv1
  recorded on 2026-08-24.

### Why srv1's August refusal happened, and why it does not recur on GPTQ

`vllm/model_executor/kernels/linear/mixed_precision/exllama.py` @ `v0.26.0`:

```python
class ExllamaLinearKernel(MPLinearKernel):
    SUPPORTED_QUANT_TYPES = [scalar_types.uint4b8, scalar_types.uint8b128]

    @classmethod
    def get_min_capability(cls) -> int:
        return 60
```

and in `can_implement`, verbatim:

```
f"Quant type ({c.weight_type}) not supported by Exllama, supported types are: ..."
```

`records/evidence/2026-08-24-knob-surface/surface.md:81` (and
`surface.json:1598`) recorded exactly that, with `(uint4)`. **`uint4` is the AWQ
scalar type** (unsigned + runtime zero-point);
`vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/utils/marlin_utils.py:80-87` labels the
two families in-source — `uint4` = "AWQ style, unsigned + runtime zero-point",
`uint4b8` = "GPTQ style, unsigned + symmetric bias".

`vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/auto_gptq.py:100-104`:

```python
# (num_bits, is_sym) -> quant_type
TYPE_MAP = {
    (4, True): scalar_types.uint4b8,
    (8, True): scalar_types.uint8b128,
}
```

So the requirement chain is exact and complete:

| requirement | source | why B2's checkpoint must satisfy it |
|---|---|---|
| `bits=4`, `sym=true` | `auto_gptq.py:100-104` | anything else is not `uint4b8`; `sym=false` is not in `TYPE_MAP` at all and raises `Unsupported quantization config` (`auto_gptq.py:157-159`) |
| `group_size > 0` and divides in-features | `exllama.py can_implement` | `group_size=128` with hidden/intermediate both multiples of 128 |
| out-features % 8 == 0 | `exllama.py can_implement` (`32 // size_bits`) | all Qwen2 projections satisfy this |
| activations fp16 | `exllama.py can_implement` — *"Exllama only supports float16 activations"* | Qwen GPTQ-Int4 repos declare `"torch_dtype": "float16"` |
| compute capability ≥ 60 | `exllama.py get_min_capability` | srv1 is 7.5 |
| dense, not MoE | `_POSSIBLE_KERNELS` holds *linear* kernels only; MoE routes to `AutoGPTQMoEMethod` / `select_wna16_moe_backend` (`auto_gptq.py:467,489`) and is filtered by `--moe-backend`, a different flag | on a MoE checkpoint `--linear-backend exllama` would bind only the attention/dense projections, so the arm would not isolate the kernel even if it launched |

`desc_act` is **not** a hard gate at TP=1 — `exllama.py` only rejects act-reorder
when input features are partitioned across devices. `desc_act=false` is still the
right choice: it sets `has_g_idx=False` (`auto_gptq.py:351`), which keeps the
weight-permute path out of the arm entirely.

### The engine names the kernel that ran — test #12's `kernel_observed`

`vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/auto_gptq.py:354-358`:

```python
kernel_type = choose_mp_linear_kernel(mp_linear_kernel_config)
if kernel_type.__name__ not in self._kernel_backends_being_used:
    logger.info("Using %s for AutoGPTQLinearMethod", kernel_type.__name__)
```

So B1 must log `Using MarlinLinearKernel for AutoGPTQLinearMethod` and B2
`Using ExllamaLinearKernel for AutoGPTQLinearMethod`. This is the same line
shape srv2 already emitted for AWQ —
`records/evidence/2026-08-24-resolved-config/srv2-startup.log:21`,
`auto_awq.py:473 Using MarlinLinearKernel for AutoAWQMarlinLinearMethod` — so the
field is known to be harvestable from the container log.

### The proposed fallback contrast is INVALID in v0.26.0

`vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/__init__.py` @ `v0.26.0`, lines 152-154:

```python
"auto_gptq": AutoGPTQConfig,
"gptq":      AutoGPTQConfig,
"gptq_marlin": AutoGPTQConfig,
```

All three names resolve to **one class**. v0.26.0 merged the old `gptq.py` and
`gptq_marlin.py` into a single `auto_gptq.py` (the tree at tag `v0.26.0` contains
`vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/auto_gptq.py` and **no** `gptq.py` or
`gptq_marlin.py`). `AutoGPTQConfig.override_quantization_method`
(`auto_gptq.py:220-238`) treats `gptq`, `gptq_marlin`, `auto_gptq` and `marlin`
as one interchangeable set of user strings and returns `cls.get_name()` for all
of them.

Consequence: **`--quantization gptq` vs `--quantization gptq_marlin` moves
nothing.** Both give the same config object, the same
`choose_mp_linear_kernel()` call, and therefore the same kernel. A B1/B2 pair
built on that contrast would print two different flags and run one kernel twice
— the exact failure mode `test_the_engine_log_names_the_kernel_that_actually_ran`
exists to catch (cf. `--cpu-offload-params experts`).

The doc's `Blockers` bullet at `lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:136-139` should be struck
and replaced by:

```
B1  --linear-backend marlin    -> MarlinLinearKernel   (mma.sync PTX on sm75)
B2  --linear-backend exllama   -> ExllamaLinearKernel  (__hfma2, no mma.sync)
```

one flag, one variable, same checkpoint. `marlin` is named explicitly rather than
left to `auto` so that the CONFIG row records a flag rather than a default, and
so `_LINEAR_BACKEND_KERNEL_MAP` filtering is on in both arms symmetrically.

Marlin is reachable on sm75, so B1's premise holds:
`kernels/linear/mixed_precision/marlin.py` `get_min_capability() -> 75`, and
`marlin_utils.py:64-65` gates only `device_capability < 75`.

**Residual risk (UNVERIFIED, on-rig).** `AutoGPTQLinearMethod.__init__`
(`auto_gptq.py:320-324`) calls `verify_marlin_supported(quant_type, group_size)`
*unconditionally*, before the chooser runs. For `uint4b8`/`g128` on sm75 the
source says this passes, but it has not been executed on srv1. If B2 dies with a
Marlin message rather than an Exllama one, that assert is the cause and it is a
finding, not a setup error — record it as a REFUSED row with the reason.

## (A) A dense GPTQ 4-bit checkpoint for a 6144 MiB card

### A correction to the blocker's premise — WHICH WAS ITSELF WRONG. Read both.

**What this document said on 2026-09-01, and what was wrong with it.** It said:
"`lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:132` says srv1's only GPTQ is
`Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B-Chat-GPTQ-Int4`. That string appears **nowhere** in this repo
outside that sentence … So the blocker understates the problem: B2 has no GPTQ
checkpoint of *any* shape." That correction was **refuted on the rig on
2026-09-02**. srv1 does hold `Qwen/Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B-Chat-GPTQ-Int4`. The run
doc's original premise was right and the correction above it was wrong; the
`UNVERIFIED` hedge ("the inventory is a week old and the file may exist
unrecorded") is the half of that paragraph that held up.

**Measured on srv1, 2026-09-02**, at
`~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--Qwen--Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B-Chat-GPTQ-Int4`
(snapshot `81b132adfae58e03b96ae1ed1f0d578d0cc4d09a`): **7.9 G on disk, three
shards** (4,000,527,016 + 3,791,651,312 + 622,329,984 B). Its `config.json`
declares `architectures: ["Qwen2MoeForCausalLM"]` and
`quantization_config: {quant_method: gptq, bits: 4, group_size: 128,
desc_act: false, sym: true}`. So srv1's GPTQ inventory is not empty, and the
2026-08-31 scan (`records/evidence/2026-08-31-inventory/srv1-scan.txt:96-109`,
the `=== HF cache ===` listing) does not name it — the scan is what was stale,
not the run doc.

**The conclusion does not move. Only the reason for it does.** B2 still cannot
use this checkpoint, and *not* because srv1 has no GPTQ file:

- It is **MoE**. `_POSSIBLE_KERNELS` holds *linear* kernels only; a Qwen2Moe
  checkpoint routes its expert GEMMs through `AutoGPTQMoEMethod` /
  `select_wna16_moe_backend` (`auto_gptq.py:467,489`), selected by
  `--moe-backend`, a different flag. `--linear-backend exllama` would bind only
  the attention and dense projections, so the arm would not isolate the kernel
  even if it launched. This is the same requirement the table below already
  states as "dense, not MoE".
- And it would not fit anyway: 7.9 G of weights against a 6144 MiB card.

So a dense GPTQ 4-bit checkpoint must still be fetched, and
`Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` is still the recommendation. What
changes is that "srv1 holds no GPTQ checkpoint of any shape" must not be repeated
anywhere: it is false.

### The budget

srv1 is `6144 MiB` total, `5745 MiB` free at idle with 399 MiB reserved
(`records/evidence/2026-08-31-inventory/srv1-scan.txt:43`). Under
`--gpu-memory-utilization` the KV pool is whatever survives the weights, and
`test_two_backends_on_one_checkpoint_is_the_only_pair.py` requires the pool to be
comparable across the two arms — so the checkpoint must leave *slack*, not just
fit. Guideline 8 of the run doc prices a launch near the memory edge at a
1-in-3 coin flip. Target: weights ≤ 2 GiB, leaving ≳3 GiB of KV at util 0.85.

Per-token fp16 KV, from each config's own `num_hidden_layers`,
`num_key_value_heads` and `hidden_size/num_attention_heads`:

| model | layers | kv heads | head dim | B/token | tokens per GiB |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.5B | 28 | 2 | 128 | 28,672 | ~37,400 |
| 3B | 36 | 2 | 128 | 36,864 | ~29,100 |
| 7B | 28 | 4 | 128 | 57,344 | ~18,700 |

### A trap worth recording

**None of the Qwen GPTQ-Int4 repos ships a `quantize_config.json`.** All four
`https://huggingface.co/<repo>/resolve/main/quantize_config.json` fetches return
**HTTP 404**. The quantisation parameters live in `config.json` under
`quantization_config`, which is where vLLM reads them from
(`AutoGPTQConfig.from_config`, `auto_gptq.py:201-211`, via
`get_from_keys(config, ["desc_act"])` / `["sym"]`). Any fetch script that checks
only `quantize_config.json` will report "missing config" for exactly the right
checkpoints and "present" for the older TheBloke-style ones.

### Candidates

#### 1. `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` — RECOMMENDED

- Parameters: **1,543,714,304** total in the quantised file (1,310,195,712 I32 +
  233,518,592 F16); base model is Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, dense `Qwen2ForCausalLM`,
  28 layers, hidden 1536, intermediate 8960, GQA 12/2.
- On disk: single `model.safetensors`, **1,149,862,960 B = 1.071 GiB**; whole
  repo ≈ 1.161 GiB with tokenizer/vocab/merges.
  (`https://huggingface.co/api/models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4?blobs=true`)
- `quantize_config.json`: **absent (HTTP 404)**. From
  `https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4/resolve/main/config.json`,
  `quantization_config` verbatim:

```json
{"batch_size": 1, "bits": 4, "block_name_to_quantize": null,
 "cache_block_outputs": true, "damp_percent": 0.01, "dataset": null,
 "desc_act": false, "exllama_config": {"version": 1}, "group_size": 128,
 "max_input_length": null, "model_seqlen": null,
 "module_name_preceding_first_block": null, "modules_in_block_to_quantize": null,
 "pad_token_id": null, "quant_method": "gptq", "sym": true, "tokenizer": null,
 "true_sequential": true, "use_cuda_fp16": false, "use_exllama": true}
```

  `bits=4` ✓ `sym=true` ✓ `group_size=128` ✓ `desc_act=false` ✓ — and the
  checkpoint literally ships `"use_exllama": true` with an `exllama_config`.
  `"torch_dtype": "float16"` ✓ satisfies exllama's activation gate.
  1536 % 128 == 0 and 8960 % 128 == 0, so the group size divides every
  in-features ✓.
- Budget: 1.07 GiB of weights leaves roughly 4.1 GiB at util 0.85 ≈ **150k KV
  tokens** at fp16 — vastly more than the run's `levels 1,4,8` need, so the two
  arms' pools cannot diverge for lack of room.
- **The decisive argument:** its AWQ sibling
  `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-AWQ` is already the standing vLLM model on
  both rigs — `records/headers/2026-08-22-coresidency-feasibility.json:8`,
  `records/headers/2026-08-24-ramp-tokens.json:7`,
  `records/evidence/2026-08-24-resolved-config/srv2-startup.log:4`, and the only
  vLLM entry in `tools/bench/serving/configs/srv-full.json`
  (`records/headers/2026-08-22-cpu-offload.json:33`). Same architecture, same
  tokenizer, same shapes, same launch geometry — the vLLM pair lands on a model
  the campaign's drivers and null already know how to price. This is not a
  cross-engine comparison; it just removes one class of surprise.

#### 2. `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` — ACCEPTED, second choice

- Parameters: **3,085,938,688** (2,774,532,096 I32 + 311,406,592 F16); dense
  `Qwen2ForCausalLM`, 36 layers, hidden 2048, intermediate 11008, GQA 16/2.
- On disk: single `model.safetensors`, **2,067,756,448 B = 1.926 GiB**; repo
  ≈ 2.016 GiB.
- `quantize_config.json`: **absent (HTTP 404)**. `config.json` →
  `quantization_config` is byte-identical in every field that matters:
  `"bits": 4, "group_size": 128, "desc_act": false, "sym": true,
  "quant_method": "gptq", "use_exllama": true, "exllama_config": {"version": 1}`,
  `damp_percent 0.01`, `true_sequential true`, `use_cuda_fp16 false`.
  `"torch_dtype": "float16"` ✓. 2048 % 128 == 0, 11008 % 128 == 0 ✓.
- Budget: 1.93 GiB of weights leaves ≈3.2 GiB at util 0.85 ≈ **93k KV tokens**.
  Comfortable. Its AWQ sibling is also on both rigs
  (`records/evidence/2026-08-31-inventory/srv1-scan.txt:100`), so the same
  familiarity argument applies one notch weaker.
- Use this if the 1.5B turns out too small to make a kernel difference visible
  above the null.

#### 3. `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` — ACCEPTED, fallback only

- Parameters: **1,543,714,304**; dense `Qwen2ForCausalLM`, 28 layers, hidden
  1536, intermediate 8960.
- On disk: `model.safetensors` **1,149,862,960 B = 1.071 GiB** (byte-identical
  size to candidate 1 — same architecture, different fine-tune).
- `quantize_config.json`: **absent (HTTP 404)**. `config.json` →
  `quantization_config` matches on all four required fields: `"bits": 4,
  "group_size": 128, "desc_act": false, "sym": true`. `"torch_dtype": "float16"`.
- Rank 3 only because it is not the Coder line, so it shares nothing with the
  workload the rest of the campaign runs. Config-wise it is as good as #1.

### Rejected

#### `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` — REJECTED on budget, not config

- Config is **fine**: `"bits": 4, "group_size": 128, "desc_act": false, "sym":
  true, "quant_method": "gptq"`, `torch_dtype float16`, hidden 3584 (28×128),
  intermediate 18944 (148×128). `quantize_config.json` also 404s.
- Rejected because of size: `model-00001-of-00002.safetensors` 3,999,234,216 B +
  `model-00002-of-00002.safetensors` 1,576,146,928 B = **5,575,381,144 B =
  5.193 GiB** of weights on a **6.000 GiB** card. After the ~0.39 GiB the driver
  already reserves at idle there is essentially nothing left for a KV pool, and
  at 56 KiB/token even 200 MiB buys under 4k tokens. srv1 has recorded launches
  at this edge failing as a 1-in-3 coin flip (run doc, guideline 8), which is
  precisely the noise that would make B1 and B2 incomparable.

#### `TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GPTQ` — REJECTED on config

- This repo *does* ship
  `https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GPTQ/resolve/main/quantize_config.json`,
  verbatim:

```json
{"bits": 4, "group_size": 128, "damp_percent": 0.1, "desc_act": true,
 "static_groups": false, "sym": true, "true_sequential": true,
 "model_name_or_path": null, "model_file_base_name": "model"}
```

- **`desc_act` is `true` on `main`.** Rejected on the stated criterion. It would
  in fact still run at TP=1 (exllama only refuses act-reorder when input features
  are sharded), but it drags `has_g_idx=True` and the `torch.argsort` weight
  permute into the arm, adding a variable the pair is supposed to hold fixed.
  TheBloke repos carry alternate branches; a `desc_act=false` branch was **not**
  checked — **UNVERIFIED**.

### Ranking for the 6 GiB budget

| rank | repo | weights | KV headroom @ util 0.85 | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` | 1.071 GiB | ~4.1 GiB / ~150k tok | **use this** |
| 2 | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` | 1.926 GiB | ~3.2 GiB / ~93k tok | good |
| 3 | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` | 1.071 GiB | ~4.1 GiB / ~150k tok | fine, off-workload |
| — | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` | 5.193 GiB | ~0 | rejected, budget |
| — | `TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GPTQ` | 0.72 GiB | ample | rejected, `desc_act=true` |

The KV-headroom column is arithmetic on the config dimensions, not a measurement.
vLLM's own `# GPU blocks:` line prices the real pool and must be recorded per arm
— **UNVERIFIED** until then.

## The "two checkpoints on disk are already mislabelled" claim

`lcp-vllm-3-arm-run.md:134-135` asserts this without a citation, and **no note
saying so exists anywhere in `records/` or `archive/`** — searched for
`mislabel*`, `misnamed`, `not actually`, `despite the name`. The claim as
written is **UNVERIFIED**. What *is* verifiable is a set of name-vs-content
mismatches on the shared store, any two of which the sentence may be pointing at:

1. **`~/models/moe/nemotron-30b-awq/` is not AWQ.** vLLM resolves it as
   `quantization=compressed-tensors` — twice, on srv1:
   `records/evidence/2026-08-31-inventory/srv1-vllm-nemotronh-moe-loadtest.log:20`
   and `srv1-vllm-nemotronh-offload12-mml1024.log:21`. The directory name says
   AWQ; the engine says compressed-tensors. This one is a real, logged
   contradiction, and it is already causing damage —
   `archive/docs/board-findings-2026-08-31.md:131` records the offload gate as
   right "for the Qwen2/AWQ cells" while compressed-tensors/NemotronH is
   **unmeasured**.
2. **`~/models/dense/nvidia_OpenCodeReasoning-Nemotron-7B-Q4_K_{M,S}.gguf` are
   Qwen2, not Nemotron.** `records/evidence/2026-08-27-spec-decoding/store/README.md`
   annotates both as "qwen2 arch, vocab 152064". Two files, one model family
   misnamed — arguably the "two checkpoints" the sentence means.
3. **`~/models/moe/4b-Q4_K_M.gguf` names no model at all** and is filed under
   `moe/`; the store README has to gloss it as "(gpt-oss-4b draft)".
4. **`~/models/moe/Ornith-1.0-35B_Q3_K_M.gguf` (18,134,220,000 B) and
   `KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev_Q3_K_M_imatrix_MTP.gguf` (18,134,220,160 B)** sit 160
   bytes apart on srv1 (`srv1-scan.txt:70,79`), and the store README lists the
   KAT file but not the Ornith one. Suspicious, **UNVERIFIED** — needs a GGUF
   header read, which is on-rig.

**The operational consequence is the same whichever two were meant, and it is the
one that matters for B2: a checkpoint's directory or file name is not evidence of
its quantisation format.** Read `config.json` → `quantization_config` (or
`quantize_config.json` where one exists) and record `bits`/`sym`/`group_size`/
`desc_act` into the CONFIG row, so
`test_a_refusal_is_recorded_as_the_result_it_is`'s `checkpoint_quant` field
carries a value that was read rather than inferred from a path.

## What B2 should run

```
B1  --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4 --linear-backend marlin
B2  --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4 --linear-backend exllama
```

Everything else held: `--dtype float16` (exllama refuses anything else), and
`model`, `weights_sha256`, `img`, `util`, `len`, `seqs`, `kv` identical across
the pair per `HELD` in
`tests/test_two_backends_on_one_checkpoint_is_the_only_pair.py`.

`kernel_observed` comes from the engine log line
`Using {Marlin,Exllama}LinearKernel for AutoGPTQLinearMethod`
(`auto_gptq.py:357`), not from the flag.

Do **not** write the pair as `--quantization gptq` vs `gptq_marlin`: in v0.26.0
those are the same class and would produce two rows and one kernel.
