# Shipped data

Two files ship as data rather than as code:
`capability-table.json` (estimates, by card class, of what a model costs and
how well it codes, below) and `task-catalog.json` (the vocabulary of what
mcgyvr can be asked to do, at the end of this file).

## Capability data

`capability-table.json` holds estimates of what a model costs to serve.
`mcgyvr capabilities` lists them, and `mcgyvr emit` sizes a unit from the row
whose `id` equals the unit's model, unless a unit in fleet.yaml declares that
model, for example under `launch` or as `room_mib`. `mcgyvr init` does not read
the table: it binds the models running servers list. The estimates exist so that
serving can be sized **without benchmarking the user's machine**, which would
turn an install into a benchmarking session.

## What its numbers are

Every figure in the table is an **estimate**. None is a reading of your
machine.

- **A card class.** Each quality and speed figure names the card class it is
  given for (`card_class`), and each class is declared once in
  `card_classes` with an id, a label and the nominal memory of its cards.
- **One card per class.** One card was read for each class, so a class is a
  rough guide. Speed depends on the card, not only on its memory: two cards
  with the same memory can differ a lot.
- **Through another server program.** Each figure's `backend` says which
  server program it was taken through. Most were taken through one this
  product does not run, with a file of the same model, usually of the same
  quantisation type; a reading's `note` says when it was not. That file is
  not necessarily the one you will serve.
- **Ratios more than absolutes.** Read the speed figures as ratios between
  models (which is faster, and by roughly how much; how much a marginal fit
  costs) rather than as the speed your card will reach.
- **No provenance here.** Where and when the figures were taken is not
  recorded in the product.

Quality is HumanEval+ pass@1, greedy decoding, EvalPlus v0.4.0.dev44, 164
tasks. Speed is generation rate in tokens per second; a figure's `note` says
when it is not a single request (one vLLM figure is an aggregate at 16
concurrent requests).

A model with no valid quality figure carries an empty `quality` array rather
than a guess, and is never proposed.

## What the table is not

HumanEval+ ranks models on short, self-contained function synthesis. It is a
usable proxy for "can this worker execute a tightly-scoped contract" and a
poor proxy for anything else. It says nothing about a model's behaviour on a
repository it can see, on multi-hunk edits, or on instruction adherence
under a constrained output protocol. Treat it as an ordering, not a
prediction.

## Known-bad figures

The table carries a `harness_caveats` block, and models carry
`invalid_measurements` / `disputed_measurements` arrays alongside their valid
figures. These are kept rather than deleted because the failures are
instructive and repeatable:

- **CAV-01** — Ollama's `/api/generate` returns invalid HumanEval+ scores for
  Qwen2.5-Coder 7B and larger (32.3% vs a true 84.1%). Anyone revising these
  estimates through that path will silently produce a table that routes away
  from the best models available.
- **CAV-02** — `qwen3-coder-30b-a3b` left to Ollama's tag resolution spills
  to CPU on a 12 GB card and scores 3.7%; the model must be bound to an
  explicit GGUF quant under llama-server.
- **CAV-03** — the published gpt-oss-20b score is attributed to an
  insufficient output budget in the harness rather than to the model, and is
  therefore not used.
- **CAV-04** — a marginal VRAM fit degrades rather than failing, which makes
  it look like a working binding.

## Revising the estimates

There is no regeneration script: the file is edited by hand when the project
revises its estimates. No mcgyvr command writes it. When taking
new figures, use an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (llama-server or vLLM) rather
than a backend-native generate API, and pin the quantisation explicitly —
CAV-01 and CAV-02 are both consequences of not doing so.


# The decomposition catalog — validation

`task-catalog.json` is the vocabulary of what mcgyvr can be asked to do (#15).
Each entry states what accepting it promises (`guarantee`), which family of the
ladder it may start on (`starts_on`), and what evidence a contract of that type
must carry (`required_evidence`).

It is data, not code, for a reason with teeth: adding a task type must be an
edit to this file and nothing else. `tests/test_catalog.py` proves that by
inventing a type (`sql_migration`) in a temporary file and driving it through
contract validation — a test that only passes while the code is genuinely
generic over the vocabulary.

## Why a family, not a rung

An entry says it starts on `deterministic`, `local` or `api` rather than naming
a rung. Rung names are chosen by whoever wrote the config, so a catalog naming
them would only be valid on the machine it was written for. A family resolves
against any ladder — a rung is `api` exactly when its unit declares an
`api_key_env` — and it is a *floor*: a dearer rung satisfies a cheaper family,
never the reverse.

The start is the *type's* floor only; escalation climbs from it (#24), and
that is not decided here.

## How the inherited vocabulary was validated

The starting list came from local-ai's triage map and was inherited, not
validated. The evidence available to judge it is the capability table above,
and its limits decide most of the answers: HumanEval+ ranks models on short,
self-contained function synthesis against a stated signature, and says nothing
about multi-hunk edits or about behaviour on a repository the model can see.

So `function_implementation` is the one entry the measurements directly warrant
— it is that shape exactly — and `docstring` is warranted by measurement only
weakly, leaning on `no_semantic_change`, a structural comparison the gate makes
without running anything. Every other entry is carried on a *structural*
argument, recorded per entry in its `warrant` field: the evidence is a tool's
output (`format`, `import_sort`, `lint_fix`), the index's own resolution
(`rename_symbol`), a checker's verdict (`type_annotation`), or a scope boundary
that removes the failure mode (`test_scaffold` cannot make a test pass by
editing what it tests).

`bug_fix` is the honest weak spot, and its `warrant` says so: nothing measured
covers diagnosis. What makes a cheap attempt safe to make anyway is
`failing_test_first` — with a demonstration required up front, a worker that did
not understand the defect produces a change that visibly fails rather than a
plausible one that lands.

## What was removed, and why

Removals live in the `excluded` block rather than being deleted, for the same
reason the capability table keeps its known-bad measurements: the next person to
reach for `multi_file_refactor` should find out why it is absent instead of
rediscovering it. Both the loader and `mcgyvr catalog <name>` surface the reason
rather than reporting "unknown type".

They fall into three groups:

- **Structurally unservable.** `multi_file_refactor` — the worker output
  protocol is one file's complete content in one fenced block (#25), so no model
  rung can emit a coordinated multi-file change at all. `rename_symbol` is the
  one multi-file operation the catalog carries, and it is deterministic
  precisely because the index resolves the references instead of a model
  guessing them.
- **No acceptance evidence exists.** `interface_design` has no command that can
  fail, so the gate cannot accept it and a model verifier would be the only
  judge — spending expensive tokens to decide whether expensive tokens were well
  spent. `comment_addition` has nothing the gate can distinguish from no change
  at all. `config_edit` has no language adapter (the gate's adapters are
  Python and JavaScript/TypeScript only), so acceptance would rest on the file
  still parsing.
- **Not a distinct guarantee.** `algorithm_implementation` differs from
  `function_implementation` only in how hard the prompt is.
  `simple_bug_fix`/`complex_bug_fix` encode difficulty in the type name, and
  difficulty is already what escalation (#24) climbs over — a second copy in
  the vocabulary is a copy that can disagree with the first.
  `string_literal_edit` is an exact edit at a known location — a tool's job,
  not a kind of work to route.
