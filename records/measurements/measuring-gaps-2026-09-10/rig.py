"""The primitives every arm in this campaign shares.

Lifted from `records/measurements/ram-headroom-2026-09-09/sweep.py` so the
figures are comparable: the same door, the same `calendar.timegm` reading of
`StartedAt`, the same envelope-move-aside dance before every `serve`.

Two things are new here and both are instruments the earlier campaign did not
need:

* :func:`sample_start` runs a 1 Hz sampler on the rig for the whole of a load,
  so a *peak* card figure is available and not only a steady-state one. The
  loading mode's cost (G1) is a load-time CUDA allocation, and a steady-state
  read cannot see it.
* :func:`vllm` talks to the vLLM dev endpoints (`/sleep`, `/wake_up`,
  `/is_sleeping`), which only answer on a unit launched
  `--enable-sleep-mode` with `VLLM_SERVER_DEV_MODE=1`.
