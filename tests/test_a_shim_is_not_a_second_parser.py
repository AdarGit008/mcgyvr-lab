"""``tests/sweeprows.py`` is a shim over ``tools/runs/rows.py``, not a second parser.

The parser lives with the door: ``python -m mcgyvr.serving.run`` reads back
every artifact a step wrote with ``rows.read()`` before it exits 0 (gate 8),
and a parser under ``tests/`` would run only in CI, post-hoc, over one
hard-coded directory. The behaviour tests import ``tests.sweeprows`` — so it
stays, as a re-export.

What must not happen is the obvious drift: two files, both called the parser,
one read by the door and one read by the tests, agreeing on one day and on
nothing after. So the shim is held to the module it fronts — every public name,
the same object — rather than trusted to be a copy.
