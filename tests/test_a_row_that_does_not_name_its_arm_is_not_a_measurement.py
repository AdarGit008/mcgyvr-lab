"""Identity belongs on the row, not in a header comment.

Two runs under a floating ``:server-cuda`` tag cannot be compared, with nothing
in the record to say the binary moved. One level down: in
``srv1-nomma-dp4a-ab.tsv`` the stock and no-MMA arms carry **byte-identical
labels**, and ``img=`` never appears on a measurement row at all. A reader that
collapses rows by label keeps one arm of that file and discards the other
silently.

A locally built tag is worse than a registry tag, not better: ``llamacpp:...-v3``
exists on one machine and any rebuild silently re-points it, with no registry to
appeal to. So it must additionally resolve to a build stamp.
