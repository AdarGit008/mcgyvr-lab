"""A bench row is filed under the backend that ran, and a backend the image
declared but did not run is a refusal, not a number.

An arm built with ``GGML_VULKAN=ON`` whose ``libggml-vulkan.so`` finds no
Vulkan device falls back to the CPU backend without a word, and its ``BENCH``
rows are the host CPU's. llama-bench's own report says ``backend: CPU`` on
every entry; a step that does not read it files the CPU's numbers under the
Vulkan arm.

So the parser carries ``backend=`` from the report into every row, and
``tools/runs/_common.sh`` has ``backend_verdict DECLARED MEASURED``: the image's own
``org.mcgyvr.build.backend`` label against what llama-bench reported. A
declared ``vulkan`` that measured ``CPU`` exits non-zero with the reason; an
image that declares nothing (the upstream ``server-cuda`` image, arm A1) is
not judged. ``3-llama-bench.sh`` files a ``refused`` row on that verdict
instead of ``BENCH`` rows.

Through the door, step 3 benches its default arm list: its arm selection and
models directory are environment knobs (``RUN_ARMS``, ``RUN_MODELS_DIR``) the
door refuses as ambient, so what a test can reach is the door's own
``--model`` (the blob as the rig sees it, ``/models/<path>``; the step strips
the mount prefix and checks ``$HOME/models/<path>`` locally) and a ``sleep``
on PATH that returns at once, in front of the ``retry3`` waits.
