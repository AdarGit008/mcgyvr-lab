"""A failed lock-fleets start files its exit cause; a failed retry gets a diagnostic.

Owner ruling, 2026-09-15: "Fix PR, then one diagnostic start". ``rig-id-relock``'s
srv2-01 (unit ``srv2_35b_256k``) exited before ``/health`` said ok, and so did its
one retry, srv2-01-retry1, 42 s in. The retry's whole docker log
(``records/evidence/2026-09-15-lock-fleets/``
``rig-id-relock-srv2-c1-srv2_35b_256k-retry1.srv2_35b_256k.docker.log``) ends at
"warming up the model" and ``[expert cache] io_uring_queue_init failed``, a line
known to be non-fatal: the process died with no stated cause. ``_unit.sh``'s
``finish()`` removed the container, so its exit code, OOMKilled, State.Error and
the rig's kernel log were never filed, and the retry ruling gives no second retry.

* A unit step that fails after ``docker run`` files, before anything removes the
  container, its ``docker inspect`` State (through the door's docker shim) and
  the rig's kernel log from START to now (``journalctl -k``, through the door's
  ssh shim) in the artifact's ``exit``, and its ``failure`` names the exit code
  and OOMKilled. A kernel log that cannot be read is filed as data, never a stop.
* A logged failed retry of a unit entry gets ONE diagnostic start, ``plan.py
  diagnose``: ``<entry>-diag1`` with its own wrapper and artifact, listed under
  ``diagnostics`` in ``<use>/retries.json`` and placed right after the failed
  retry. The retry's re-check passes as diagnosed and the diagnostic runs next.
  A passing diagnostic stands in for the failed entry as a passing retry would;
  it gets no retry, re-run or second diagnostic.

No rig is reached: the step runs under a stand-in door against stubs.
