"""A row that cannot name its rig decays into a story about an afternoon.

A throughput artifact that does not record host CPU, RAM and clock state at
measurement time decays: RAM moves between rigs, a spec quoted days after it
was read is wrong, and a rig's max clock changes with nobody having touched it.

Two rules. Every measurement row resolves to a complete stamp, re-read per arm
rather than once per file. And the state read at the end equals the state read at
the start, because a hard lock wipes the BIOS profile — PL1 reads a different
number after one — and a lock takes the ssh pipe with it, so a run that
ends silently is exactly the run whose end state is unknown.
