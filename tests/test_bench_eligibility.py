"""The eligible set for the capacity levers, and the headroom that bounds it.

Issue: `#266 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/266>`_.

These freeze a finding rather than a preference. #266 asks whether the bench's
material can carry a scaffold manipulation at all; the answer is computed from
the corpus and the committed runs, and it is pinned here so that a corpus change
which alters it fails the build instead of quietly re-opening a closed question.

Removing an entry is how a fix is proved — the same convention
``tests/test_four_lenses.py`` uses for the audit's allowlists.
