"""The bundle and the assembled prompt.

Three properties carry the weight here. The shipped Python bundle must *be* the
artifact that was measured, or the numbers describe a different file. The size
ceiling must be enforced by the loader rather than by a comment, since the
measurement says an oversized bundle degrades the worker it is meant to help.
And the assembled prompt must be reachable only through
:meth:`Contract.worker_view`, because the guarantee that orchestrator-only
fields never reach the worker is structural or it is nothing.
