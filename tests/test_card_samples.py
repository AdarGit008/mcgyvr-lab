"""The card, read while the sweep runs.

The readings that describe the machine are declared constants in
`tools/bench/serving/` (`contract.snapshot`, `CARD_STATE_COMMAND`), and the
scored sweep in `tools/breadth/measure.py` samples them once per task through
`pin`'s sampler, so a sweep that thermally throttles records why its
`latency_s` is slower.

Two properties carry most of the weight here and neither is about a number.
The first is that **an unread card cannot parse as an empty one**, which is the
distinction `COMPUTE_APPS_PROBE`'s sentinel exists for and which this composes
a second reading on top of. The second is that **the recorder cannot damage the
run it records**: a sampler that could raise, or that pays an ssh timeout per
task forever on a host that has gone away, is worse than no sampler at all.
