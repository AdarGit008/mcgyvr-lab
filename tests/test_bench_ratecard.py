"""The rate card, and the property that makes it a rate and not a total (#289).

``reproducibility.json``'s ``matching`` prose priced a null at "about 40
minutes" — one constant for every cell — beside a ``1.47pp`` bound that had the
same shape and the same defect. The card replaces the constant. These tests
hold it to three things:

* it **re-derives** from the runs on disk, so a committed record cannot drift
  from the measurement it claims to be;
* it is keyed on both axes, because the gate does not scale with the model and
  a card keyed on ``model`` alone would mis-price every ``ts`` cell;
* the prose it replaced no longer states a competing constant.

The last one is the one that would rot silently. A record that supersedes a
figure while the figure stays quotable somewhere else has not superseded it.
