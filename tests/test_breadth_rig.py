"""Offline invariants over #121's breadth instrument.

The sweep itself needs a worker; none of this does. What is checkable without
one is whether the *instrument* observes the thing it claims to:

* **No early exit.** The whole point of the measurement is the index
  distribution, and production behaviour (stop at the first gate pass) would
  truncate every observation at its own answer. If a passing first draw ended
  the task, the rows would show a distribution concentrated at zero because
  the instrument put it there.
* **The arms are what the record says they are.** The greedy anchor at
  temperature 0.0, every sampled draw at the sampled temperature, everything
  ``quality_sensitive`` — a drift here re-labels one experiment as another.
* **The index arithmetic refuses partial observations.** "No pass in N" is
  only a fact about a task whose N draws were all recorded and none lost to
  dispatch errors; a truncated task silently counted would bias the exact
  number the issue exists to measure.
