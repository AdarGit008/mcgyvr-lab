"""The lease has run on a real rig, once, and the record says so.

Gate 2 takes ``~/.mcgyvr/lease`` before any rig time is spent, a ``dev`` run yields
to a ``live`` one, and the door releases the lease on every way out. Every rig in
the lease's own tests is the stub behind the shims; this file checks that a run on
a real rig is on record.

What must be observably true, in the tree:

* under ``records/evidence/`` an envelope holds a ``<RUN_ID>.run.json``
  header (gate 5) whose ``profile`` is ``live`` and whose ``host`` is
  a rig ``tools/runs/hosts.json`` declares — the door ran, under the
  profile that takes the lease whatever holds it, against the fleet;
* that run is over: no ``.<RUN_ID>.running`` claim sits beside the header.
  The claim and the lease are released on the same way out, so a claim
  still there is a run the door never closed;
* the step ran: a file the step wrote sits beside the header, so the run
  got past the gates and spent rig time under the lease;
* the run names its product, and the product carries the lease: ``mcgyvr_version`` is a
  version at or above ``0.1.0`` and not the fallback a tree with no git reads, nor the
  ``+uninstalled`` a never-installed tree says.

Nothing here reaches a machine. The test reads the record the run leaves;
the run itself is the owner's, on the rig, once.
