"""No Ollama. Not fixed, not exempted — removed, and the tree says so.

The code that served Ollama is archived under ``archive/forensic-ollama/`` and is
not in the product.

What must be observably true: nothing in ``src/`` or ``tools/`` can dispatch to,
probe, detect, propose, or configure an Ollama backend. A protocol nobody can
reach is not "supported", it is a second path through every dispatch decision
that no test of the live ladder ever exercises.

**The ban is on the capability, not on the word.** A sweep for ``\bollama\b`` in
``src/`` and ``tools/`` would go green only by deleting things that are true: the
pointers to the archive that the last test in this file *requires* be findable, and
the provenance of measurements actually taken on that backend. A record of where a
number came from is not support for a backend. So a line whose only mention is
a citation is allowed, and everything operational is not.

#: than something it once measured. An identifier, a config value, a unit

#: branch, an env var the daemon reads or a CLI verb is a capability wherever
#: it appears — so they are flagged without consulting the citation window.

#: matters. ``tools/bench/strata.json`` is an append-only measurement record
#: whose own doctrine is "a re-assignment is a new dated block appended to
#: `blocks`, never an edit of an old one"; every block carries the endpoint the
#: sweep was pointed at, and every block carries a ``date``. Editing those to
#: satisfy a port ban would make the record say a sweep ran somewhere it did
#: not — the failure this file's own docstring says a word-ban causes.
#:
#: Narrow on purpose. A live config that dialled this port would also name the
#: backend as a value (``"api": "ollama"``) or reach it through a branch, and
#: both of those stay in :data:`OPERATIONAL` where no citation excuses them.
