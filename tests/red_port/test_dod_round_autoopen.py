"""A tree that has moved off the open round opens the next one, and is not refused.

**A moved tree does not block.** A round is a boundary in the
record, not a permission to work. The door opens the next round itself when the
tree has moved, pins the digest it is about to run against, and continues. There
is no ceiling on how many rounds a day holds; the pins are what a reader traces
a measurement back through, and a round nobody opened by hand is still a round
with one revision in it.

What must be observably true: a run against a moved tree gets a *new round*
rather than a refusal, that round pins the digest actually being run, and the
identifier still reads ``r<N>-DD-MM-YYYY`` so the existing record stays one
sequence. What must NOT change: two revisions never share a round.
