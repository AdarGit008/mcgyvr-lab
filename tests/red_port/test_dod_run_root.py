"""The evidence goes where ``$MCGYVR_RUN_ROOT`` says, and nowhere else.

The door files every run's envelope under ``<root>/records/evidence/``. A root
computed from the door's own file is the repository from a checkout and
``site-packages/`` from an installed wheel, so the root is ``$MCGYVR_RUN_ROOT`` when
that is set.

What must be observably true:

* with ``MCGYVR_RUN_ROOT`` set to an existing directory, the envelope is made
  under it, the gates read their declarations (the round, ``hosts.json``, the
  campaigns) from it, and nothing lands under the checkout the door runs from;
* with it unset, the checkout is the root;
* a value naming a path that is not an existing directory is refused before
  any gate — nothing checked, nothing made, no rig read — and the refusal names
  the variable and the rule. A root the door made silently is how evidence goes
  missing: the operator meant one directory, typed another, and a run filed
  itself where nobody looks.

The serve run is the same door with a second sequence, so the same rule is
stated for it.
