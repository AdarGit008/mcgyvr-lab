"""Moving experts between CPU and GPU can change a token.

Measured: 9 of 257 verdicts moved between ``ncmoe=0`` and ``ncmoe=99`` on one
build, against a 1.47pp own-null bound. The fiat that said otherwise is retired;
the tests below hold the retirement and keep the measurement's xfail.

The retired fiat put ``n_gpu_layers``, ``n_cpu_moe``, ``threads`` and ``mmap``
in ``tools/bench/serving/fingerprint.py``'s operational key set, with the
reasoning:

    Placement and parallelism: WHERE a tensor is computed, not WHAT is emitted.
    ... None of them alters the token distribution, so none belongs in the
    semantic pin -- and putting them there would declare two cells of one model
    at two offload settings "incomparable on output", which is exactly the
    comparison this campaign exists to make.

A fiat like that is load-bearing: a finding that a lower ``--n-cpu-moe`` floor
buys speed is a claim that a placement change bought speed and cost nothing —
and "cost nothing" is the untested half.

The same tree records backend numerics alone moving a greedy delta by 2.6pp, and
records an ollama-bundled server silently running on CPU with ``-ngl`` ignored.
So the assumption is not obviously safe, and the instrument to test it already
exists: ``tools/breadth/measure.py`` against each endpoint, paired through
``tools/bench/null.py``, which separates sampler drift (different bytes) from
acceptance drift (same bytes, different verdict).

Ling-3.0-tiny is the subject because it fits entirely on the 6 GB card at
``ncmoe=0`` and survived a 60-minute soak at ``ncmoe=99`` — the one MoE cell on
srv1 that is safe to drive.
