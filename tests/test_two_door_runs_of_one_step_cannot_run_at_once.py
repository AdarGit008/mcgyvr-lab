"""Gate 5 claims the RUN_ID atomically; a second run under it is refused.

``RUN_ID`` is ``<date>-<campaign>-<step>[-<suffix>]``. Two door invocations of
the same step, started within the same minute, mint the same id — and a
write-once check alone passes both, because neither has written its artifact
yet when the other looks. Two steps would then run against one rig under one
id, name their containers alike, and gate 7 of each would find the other's.

So gate 5 (``05-envelope.py``) claims the id before the step: ``os.open`` of
``<RUN_OUT_DIR>/.<RUN_ID>.running`` with ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL``, which exactly
one of two concurrent runs wins. The loser exits 2 saying a run with this
RUN_ID is in progress or died without releasing it, naming the file, and
leaving the decision — wait, or remove it — to the operator. The door
(``run.py``) releases the claim after gates 7 and 8, on every exit path
including an interrupt; a claim still present after a run finished is the
signature of a door that was killed outright.
