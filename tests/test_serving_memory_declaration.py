"""A serving memory declaration is bytes, and the bytes match the declaration.

A fraction of the card reads as a tuning knob and is a statement about one
*card*: the same KV cache is a different fraction on srv1 and on srv2. The rules
held here, by the numbers the tests below cite:

1. a vLLM entry declares ``kv_cache_memory_bytes`` and not
   ``gpu_memory_utilization``; an entry declaring both is a refusal;
2. the bytes are ``max_num_seqs x max_model_len x bytes_per_token``, and
   ``bytes_per_token`` is recorded with its derivation in a note;
3. there is no default: an entry declaring neither field is a refusal;
4. the footprint is recorded in MiB per rig, measured, never computed;
5. ``gpu_memory_utilization`` alone stays legal for a run whose question is the
   fraction itself.

These checks are static and cost no rig time: the measurement is in each entry's
own ``_footprint_mib``.

# srv2's 12,288 MiB card a `total capacity of 11.63 GiB`: 12,288 less 380,

# NON_KV_OVERHEAD_MIB was FITTED as a residue against that figure and carries
# the reserve inside itself. The measured branch has no such constant. These
# checks pin both halves: that the measured ceiling drops by the reserve, and
