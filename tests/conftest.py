"""Fixtures shared across the tests that touch the instrument declaration.

``tools/instruments.json`` is read by five modules and none of them is a
package, so each reaches it by path through the same ``sys.modules`` slot. This
file loads it **first** — a conftest is imported before any test module — so
every rig imported later binds *this* module object, and a fixture that patches
it here is a fixture the rigs can see. Without that ordering guarantee a test
would be patching a second copy of the declaration and wondering why the guard
still fired.

    ``srv1`` and ``srv2`` are real machines on this developer's Tailnet, and the
    suite is full of fixtures that name them — the protected sleep/wake specs
    carry ``http://srv2:8001`` because that is what the live ladder is. A test
    that resolved such a name would send a request to a real rig, so a test
    naming a rig by hostname is non-hermetic unless something prevents it.

    ``tests/test_one_door.py`` guards *spawns* — a test that reaches a rig
    through ``ssh`` — and a name is not a spawn. :func:`_offline_probes` stubs
    the two ``tools/bench`` fetchers by name, which is the same shape of guard
    one layer up and misses every other way out: :mod:`mcgyvr.availability`,
    :mod:`mcgyvr.detect` and :mod:`mcgyvr.runner` each open their own
    ``urllib.request.urlopen``.

    So the guard goes where all of them meet. Resolution itself is refused for
    every name that is not this machine, which catches the socket whoever opens
    it and whatever library they opened it with. It is a **deny-list of the
    whole world** rather than of the two rigs on purpose: a guard listing
    ``srv1`` and ``srv2`` is a guard the third rig is not in, and a hermetic
    suite has no business asking a resolver anything.

    Two ways through, and both are narrow. A test that wants a real transport
    failure uses an address that is dead by standard (:data:`_ROUTES_NOWHERE`),
    which is the only way to open a socket at something that is not this
    machine. And a test that genuinely means to reach a network patches the
    seam back itself — its own ``monkeypatch`` applies later than this one and
    wins, the same escape :func:`_offline_probes` leaves open.

    **What it does not cover**, stated so nobody reads it as more than it is: a
    subprocess resolves in its own interpreter, where this fixture is not.
    ``tests/test_one_door.py`` is the guard on that side, and it is a guard on
    what may spawn rather than on what a spawned thing may reach.
