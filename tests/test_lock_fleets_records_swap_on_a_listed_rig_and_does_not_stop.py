"""lock-fleets records swap growth on a listed rig, and does not stop there.

The owner's ruling: "Record swap on srv1, don't stop". The swap growth a wake
of that blob causes on srv1 is within what
``mcgyvr-lab/records/measurements/ram-headroom-2026-09-09/README.md`` measured
for it, with decode unaffected.

A use's ``use.json`` names the rigs whose swap growth is recorded and not
stopped on (``swap_recorded_not_stopped_on``). On such a rig a run's pswpout
start, end and delta are filed and are no reason to stop; every other stop
still applies there, and every other rig keeps the swap stop.

srv2 is on that list too ("Record swap on srv2 too"), through this same
mechanism; what that ruling says is pinned in
``tests/test_srv2_swap_is_recorded_and_does_not_stop_a_run.py``.
