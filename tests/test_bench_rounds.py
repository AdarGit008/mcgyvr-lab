"""The round, the product pin, and the mode every figure has to declare (#231).

Checks 3 and 6 of the commissioning gate. Both exist because a number on this
bench is quotable only if a reader can tell what produced it:

* **check 3** — every arm in a round runs against one product revision, and an
  adopted change lands at the round boundary rather than mid-flight.
  The pin covers the user-message render, the reply parser and the whole of
  ``Gate.run`` as well as the tasks and the system prompt, so two arms cannot be
  scored by two different bars and laid in one table.
* **check 6** — a rate says whether it describes one tier or the whole ladder.
  With escalation live a floor failure is rescued by a higher rung and the floor
  is invisible, so 12.8% means two different things and the number cannot carry
  the distinction.

The last test in this file is the one that matters most: it **discovers** the
tools that produce bench figures rather than naming them, so a tool added later
is checked by default. This project has already paid for the other shape twice —
``report.COMPARABLE`` named five fields and permitted the sixth silently, and
the mode declaration itself was a string literal in two reports while seven
other figure-producing tools said nothing at all.
