"""A TSV that parses is not yet this run's: it must open, name its round and close.

``rows.read`` accepts an empty file (no markers, no rows) and a file with no
``###`` line at all. A gate 8 (``08-parse.py``) that stopped at "it parses"
would make a step that exited 0 having written ``: > probe.tsv`` a green run
with a zero-byte artifact, and one that wrote rows and no stamps a green run
with rows nobody could tie to a rig, a round or an invocation.

So gate 8 holds the part of every declared ``.tsv`` that this run wrote —
the whole file, or the bytes after gate 5's recorded size for a
``RUN_APPENDS`` file — to three stamps: a ``### START run_id=<RUN_ID>``, the
first of the run's own stamps; a ``### ROUND id=<RUN_ROUND>
product_sha256=<RUN_PRODUCT_SHA256>``; and a ``### END run_id=<RUN_ID>``. A
zero-byte file, or one missing any of them, is exit 1 naming the file and
the missing stamp. A ``.json`` keeps its own rule (``json.loads``) and is
never held to a stamp. ``tools/runs/_common.sh``'s ``end_stamp`` writes ``run_id=`` for
the same reason ``start_stamp`` does.
