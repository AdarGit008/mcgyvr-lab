"""#230 — the instrument declaration, and the three consumers that read it.

``tools/instruments.json`` says which task sets the project measures with.
Everything here holds that declaration to being *one* declaration: the pool
gate, the reply pin and the dataset builder must all reach the same answer,
because the failure this issue was filed for is what happens when one producer
respects an instrument and the others have never heard of it.

The load-bearing case is ``d1``. It is not a copy of ``tools/bundle/tasks/``,
it **is** that directory — so a guard keyed on the name a rig happened to use
protects nothing, and #189 drew 622 training examples through exactly that gap.
