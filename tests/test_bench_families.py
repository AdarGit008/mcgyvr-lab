"""The behavioural scan's pairing rule (#268).

The scan itself is a long cross-execution over the corpus and is not run here.
What is pinned is the part that decides *which* pairs are ever executed, because
a prune that is too tight produces a clean report rather than a failure — and
that is precisely how two known families were missed.

A prune on shape **equality** compares two tasks only if they declare the same
arity per function. ``b333-pace-split`` declares ``pace_list/1`` and
``pace_of/2``; ``b302-stock-take`` and ``b277-fuel-legs`` each declare one
function of arity 2. Equality never compares them, so the containment chain
``b302 ⊂ b277 ⊂ b333`` is invisible to it; the prune is on containment.

So the three cases below are the prune's contract: containment holds in the
direction a reference can actually stand in, the alias binds by arity, and the
corpus pair that exposed the defect is executed and comes back positive.
