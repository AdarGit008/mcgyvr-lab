"""The arithmetic behind "what does the second language arm buy" (#295).

A defect here would not crash. It would publish a number that decides whether
~280 problems get authored twice or once, which is the most expensive decision
the campaign has left. So each statistic is checked against a computation that
shares no code with it: phi against the 2x2 formula worked by hand, McNemar
against an explicit enumeration of the coin flips it is a shortcut for, and the
concordance against the case it exists to separate — two arms that agree only
by failing together.

The join is checked too. Pairing on task id alone would silently marry a task's
first `ts` draw to whichever `py` draw sorted first, which is not an error a
reader of the output could see.
