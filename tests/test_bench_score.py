"""The bench's scorer, and the three ways it was silently wrong (#113).

Scoring through ``Gate.run`` is only an improvement if the workspace it scores
in is the one production would gate. Three defects found on 2026-08-12 each
produced a *plausible* pass rate, which is the dangerous kind:

* the checker's own bytecode cache read as the checker mutating the tree, so
  every Python candidate was rejected by its test runner;
* no ``pyproject.toml`` in the workspace, so ruff applied a rule set far wider
  than the project selects — 75 of 257 reference solutions rejected by a rule
  nobody chose;
* a missing linter is an *environment issue* rather than a finding, so the
  TypeScript arm was scored by three rungs while Python was scored by five and
  ``passed`` said nothing about it.

The first two are pinned here against the reference solutions, which are the
corpus's own answers and the cheapest smoke test available. The third is pinned
against the refusal, because the whole point is that it must not be silent.
