"""Ten recorded conflicts, and the check each one becomes.

Each is a contradiction between what the D7 campaign's record claims and what the
files under ``records/evidence/calibration-*`` hold. The disposition tables beside
the sinks account for the FIELDS of a row and say nothing about the VALUES inside
it; these checks read the values.

* A finding is a check, not a paragraph. Red means the defect is present; "is this
  still open?" is answered by running the suite.
* A finding that is ruled on and not fixed keeps its check, marked
  ``xfail(strict=True, reason=...)`` with a dated reason
  (``tests/test_finding_is_a_check.py`` holds the grammar). ``strict`` is what keeps
  them live: a campaign that fixes one turns XPASS and fails the suite until the
  marker comes off. Every check but K9 and K10 resolves against the newest
  campaign directory, so only a run can turn it green. K9 reads ollama's
  settings, and ollama is removed, so no run can turn it green. K10 reads
  ``tools/bench/serving/configs/``, so an edit there alone flips it.
* The append-only record names its check: the conflict and ruling blocks of
  ``mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/archive/evidence-prose/calibration-2026-08-19/README.md``
  carry K1-K10 and the owner's decisions, each naming the test below that reads it.

The two that dissolve stay as green checks rather than as a deleted paragraph:
their job is to keep a re-derived non-finding from being re-filed, and to go
red if a later campaign turns either into a real one.

**The population is the newest campaign, not one named here.** Every check but K10
resolves its evidence through :func:`campaign` — the newest ``calibration-*``
directory under ``records/evidence/``. A check pinned to one campaign's frozen
files would be an ``xfail`` that can never XPASS.

K7 asks the geometry question of every model served on both hosts, K8 asks
how wide the cross-host population is before an engine is called equivalent,
and K9 asks whether both hosts declare the settings that decide residency
instead of inheriting them.

Two checks read a wide population:

* K5 covers both engines rather than ollama alone. A vLLM width matrix quotes
  1.0 against 3.76 for the same model at the same token count, and what
  separates them is ``configured_width`` — so the declared conditions are
  ``tokens`` AND the width.
* K6 covers every figure-bearing ramp row in the campaign's journals, not only
  the rows of the ramp phase's own journal.

    differently, provided the difference is recorded and declared on the

    it fights the no-caps rule (the hardware is the limit) and would still

    multiplying two other fields.

    names the (model, host) children a cross-host figure would have rested on,

    Filed as "how wide is the cross-host evidence", on the true observation
    that ``size_vram`` agreeing to the byte says the engines allocated the same
    thing and nothing about what they then did with it, and that on 2026-08-19
    exactly one model per engine carried a figure on both hosts.

    **Ruled 2026-08-22 (owner): the question has no number.** Cross-host
    EQUIVALENCE is never claimed — srv1 and srv2 are not one instrument at any
    population — and ollama and vLLM are never equivalent either.

    Read the scope exactly. This does not forbid a cross-machine comparison:
    D1 withdrew the rigs' roles and D2 says a cross-machine question
    authorises its own run ("which machine serves the 1.5B faster"), and both
    were Accepted the same day as this ruling. What is denied is the claim that
    the two hosts are interchangeable instruments, which is the claim a
    models-per-engine floor was quietly building toward. A cross-machine
    contrast stays available and carries what it ignored, on D4's record —
    which is also K7's ruling.

    What the ruling adds is the shape underneath. Two hosts produce two
    **one-armed cells**: "how many 1.5B models fit on this card" answers itself
    on each machine and needs no second arm to be a record. A *capability*
    cell's comparison is then built by adding a second arm against it —
    typically on the same machine, differing in exactly one declared parameter,
    the same count of models at a different context. That is what makes a
    capability measurement reusable as a contrast nobody planned, and it is why
    the storage shape matters more than the population size.

    So the check is not a floor. It asks that every (host, model) reading this
    campaign took for a model seen on more than one host is stored as a
    standalone cell, in the one-directory-per-cell shape D5 defines,
    so a later contrast can take one up as an arm. Red because the newest
    campaign wrote journals and not cells — the same absence
    ``tests/test_run_contract.py`` names for D5, asked here of the specific
    readings a cross-host claim was read off.

    Cell **naming** is deliberately not asserted: the cell is matched on the
    ``host`` and ``model`` inside its own ``run.json`` (the contract makes that
    file "the terminal record — the row, provenance, identity, pre-state,
    post-state", ``archive/docs/run-contract-2026-08-22.md``).
