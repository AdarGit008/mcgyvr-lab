"""The language-idempotency census over the admitted bench (#295).

The census answers one question — could a problem be authored once and rendered
into both arms, or do the languages genuinely answer some boundaries
differently — and its number, 241 of 257 clean with none fatal, is an argument
for halving the campaign's most expensive axis. What is pinned here is that the
census reads the *admitted* material rather than a spec someone reconstructed,
and that a known-divergent problem in the tree still trips it.

The count itself is deliberately not asserted. It moves whenever a problem is
authored or retired, and a test that freezes it would be a test of the corpus's
size wearing the costume of a test of this module.
