"""The ``--n-cpu-moe`` floor is VRAM-bound, so each arm has its own.

The floor is bounded by VRAM, not host RAM, and that matters here because each
arm in this campaign carries different VRAM overhead: a Vulkan
build's allocator is not a CUDA build's, and a PTX-only build's context is not a
SASS build's. A floor copied between arms is not a floor.

Two rules. The derivation states its own inputs and the arithmetic reproduces
from them. And the floor is established by a recorded refusal one step below it,
retried, because a launch near the memory edge is a coin flip and a REFUSED
row can be a dangling HF-blob symlink read as a capability limit.
