"""This workload is 3:1 prompt:output, and a prefill verdict needs an instrument.

Both sweep drivers divide by the same wall — ``agg = gen/wall`` and
``prefill = pin/wall`` — so ``prefill/agg`` is ``ptok/otok`` identically. A
sentence claiming that "prefill gains track decode" from those rows restates
arithmetic.

So a prefill verdict needs ``llama-bench -p N``, which times prompt processing
separately with fixed synthetic token counts, no sampler, no early stop, no HTTP
and no client threads. Two consequences the tests below encode: it must report a
per-repetition spread (``-r 9``), and it must sweep ``-fa 0,1`` because the arch
change moves the flash-attention kernel selection as well as the mat-mul one,
and a single ``-fa on`` number cannot tell those apart.
