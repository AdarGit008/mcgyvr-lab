"""A patched build surviving proves nothing unless the unpatched one is recorded
dying, on the same boot, in the same session.

The defect: ``get_mmvq_mmid_max_batch`` branches on the raw runtime ``cc`` (750,
Turing) while the device kernel's ``__launch_bounds__`` are baked from
``__CUDA_ARCH__`` (610, Pascal, because the build ships only ``61-virtual`` PTX).
The host hands out a batch the compiled kernel cannot launch, and llama.cpp
aborts with ``CUDA error: invalid argument`` inside
``ggml_cuda_mul_mat_vec_q``. ``get_device_table_id``, above
``get_mmvq_mmid_max_batch`` in the same file, reads the compiled arch;
``get_mmvq_mmid_max_batch`` does not.

It is a batch-size boundary, so the run must locate the boundary rather than
poke n=8 — show the unpatched build's window and show the patched one crossing
it clean. And "clean" needs a denominator: 0 failures in 60 trials bounds the
failure rate at 5%; 30 trials only reaches 10%. One clean run bounds nothing:
it is a run that did not reproduce, never a fix.
