"""The null read's one load-bearing distinction (#231 check 1).

The headline ``d`` — verdicts that differ between two identical greedy runs —
cannot tell two very different instruments apart, and the whole reason
``tools/bench/null.py`` exists is to split them:

* **Sampler drift** — the backend returned different text and some of it landed
  on the other side of the acceptance boundary. A property of the serving
  stack.
* **Acceptance drift** — the *same bytes* scored differently. That is the
  harness being nondeterministic, it puts a floor under every contrast the
  bench will ever run, and no number of extra problems lowers it.

A defect that silently folded them together would publish a zero for the second kind
whether or not it was true, so the classification is pinned here against rows built to
contain one of each.
