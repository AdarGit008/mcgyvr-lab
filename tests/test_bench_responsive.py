"""The responsive fraction per (model + bar) x stratum, pinned.

Issue: `#224 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/224>`_, the first item
of its 2026-08-14 amendment. These freeze a measurement rather than a
preference: the fractions below are derived from committed runs, and #243's
record is four quoted figures that survived until someone re-derived them by
hand. A corpus or run change that moves them fails the build instead of quietly
re-describing the bench.

Removing an entry is how a fix is proved — the convention
``tests/test_bench_eligibility.py`` and ``tests/test_four_lenses.py`` use.
