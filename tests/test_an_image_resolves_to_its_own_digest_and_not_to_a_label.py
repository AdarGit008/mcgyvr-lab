"""Gate 3 reads ``RepoDigests`` then ``Id`` — fields, not the first digest-like string.

``docker image inspect`` prints ``RepoDigests`` and, further down,
``Config.Labels``. ``1-build-ladder.sh`` labels every rung
``org.mcgyvr.build.toolkit=$RUN_CUDA_DEVEL``, and every rung reaches srv1 by
``docker save | docker load``, so its ``RepoDigests`` is ``[]``. Pin the
toolkit by digest — the natural reproducibility move — and a resolver that
greps the whole document for the first ``@sha256:`` hands the driver
``nvidia/cuda@sha256:…``: it runs the CUDA base image instead of the rung,
the container dies, and a REFUSED row is filed against the arm for what was a
resolution bug.

So ``image_digest`` parses the document and answers ``RepoDigests[0]`` if
there is one, else ``Id``. The ``docker`` behind the shim is a stub printing
the real shape; the call runs under ``onedoor.fake_door`` because
``image_digest`` proves the door before it resolves the shim.
