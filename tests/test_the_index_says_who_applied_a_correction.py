"""A folded row says who applied the correction it is carrying.

:func:`mcgyvr.telemetry.correct` requires its ``orchestrator`` and writes it as
``applied_by`` on every correction line, because the one applying a correction
need not be the one that ran the attempt: the gate that judged, the review that
rejected and the orchestrator that took the work off the out-queue are three
different writers, and a verdict whose author is unknown is a verdict a reviewer
cannot weigh. ``tools/live/index.py`` declares an ``applied_by`` column for
exactly that question.

``index.attempts`` drops the correction records themselves, so ``fold`` carries
``applied_by`` onto the attempt with ``outcome`` and ``detail`` — otherwise the
one place it is written is the one place nothing reads it. It moves with the
outcome it belongs to: the detail is the winning outcome's words and the author
is the winning outcome's writer, and reporting one correction's prose or byline
beside another's verdict would name somebody for a judgement they did not make.
