"""What a card actually has, and what the 2026-08-30 run recorded about it.

Four findings from that day are pinned here as assertions rather than prose,
because each was reached by measurement and each was got WRONG first by
reasoning:

1. **A card has four buckets, not three.** ``total = reserved + used + free``.
   The reserve is GSP firmware -- the GPU System Processor, default on Turing
   and later, which is both rigs -- and it is held from driver load until
   reboot. Confirmed on the hardware: ``nvidia-smi -q -d MEMORY`` reports
   ``Reserved 401 MiB`` on srv1 (GSP 580.173.02) and ``380 MiB`` on srv2
   (GSP 595.84), while ``memory.used`` reads 17 MiB on both with nothing
   running. It is a fixed carveout and does not scale with capacity, so it is
   regressive: 6.5% of srv1's 6 GB card against 3.1% of srv2's 12 GB.

2. **CUDA cannot see the reserve at all.** srv2's OOM message reports "GPU 0 has
   a total capacity of 11.63 GiB" for a 12,288 MiB card -- exactly
   ``12288 - 380``. So a declaration weighed against ``memory.total`` is weighed
   against memory no process can obtain.

3. **``--cpu-offload-gb`` is not a discount on this engine.** Three launches of
   Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct-AWQ on srv2 differing only in the budget -- 0, 4
   and 6 GiB -- each reported ``Model loading took 9.38 GiB`` and each OOMed
   before startup. A gate that subtracted the declared budget from the weights
   was written and removed the same day: it converted a correct refusal into an
   admission, and the cell it admitted died at load.

4. **One predicted overhead constant cannot serve both hosts.** The residue a
   cell actually leaves -- ``footprint - weights - declared KV`` -- measured
   180-374 MiB on srv1 and 715-791 MiB on srv2. CUDA graph capture accounts for
   only 70 MiB of that gap, measured by launching one 3B on srv2 with and
   against ``--enforce-eager``; the rest is the attention backend (srv1 falls
   back to TRITON on CC 7.5, srv2 runs FLASHINFER). This is why every entry in
   that run declares a MEASURED ``_footprint_mib`` and is weighed by its reading
   instead of by the prediction.
