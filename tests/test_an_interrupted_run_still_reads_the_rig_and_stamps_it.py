"""Gate 7 runs on the interrupt path too — that is the path it exists for.

A hard lock takes the ssh pipe with it, and the run whose end state is
unknown is exactly the one that ended silently; Ctrl-C on a hung health loop
is the same shape. The archived door's first cut ran gate 7 INSIDE the
``INT``/``TERM`` trap handler, where the nested rig read came back with the
signal's status and no output, so every interrupted run reported "the rig
could not be re-read … its end state is unknown" and the ``### RIGMOVED``
comparison was never reached.

So the signal only ends the entry that was running; gates 7 and 8 run in the
door's main flow, and the door exits 130 afterwards (``run.py:main``). The
signal is delivered to the door's whole process group, as a terminal
delivers Ctrl-C; the rig reads differently once the step has run.
