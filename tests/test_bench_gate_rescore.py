"""Hand-built cases for the gate re-scorer, with verdicts derived from rung order.

Issue: `#224 <https://github.com/AdarGit008/mcgyvr/issues/224>`_ A2, hole 1.
The tool under test is ``tools/bench/gate_rescore.py``.

**These expectations are not read off the tool.** Every candidate below is a few
lines written by hand, and its expected verdict is derived from the rung order
``mcgyvr.gate.runner``'s docstring states and ``Gate._run_adapter`` implements:

    scope, secrets  (stop here if either fires)
    structured data
    per adapter, per file: syntax, then structure
    per adapter, batched: lint, then format
    acceptance

with ``rejected_by`` being ``findings[0].check`` (``score.as_verdict``). A test
whose expected value is whatever the tool printed would pass against a tool that
scores every candidate ``lint`` and would be worth nothing; the point of the
re-score is that a *specific* rung rejected, so the specific rung is what is
asserted, and it is asserted against the order rather than against the output.

The cases are named for the property each one holds. Between them they cover the
four verdicts a re-score can reach that the acceptance-only scorer could not
(scope, lint, format, and lint-beats-format), the two verdicts the two scorers
share (clean pass, acceptance failure), and the three rows a re-score must
refuse to grade (dispatch error, parse refusal, a candidate that no longer
parses).
