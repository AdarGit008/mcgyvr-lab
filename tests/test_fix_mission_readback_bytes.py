"""The mission runner reads a delivered file back the way the tree wrote it.

``tools/missions/run.py`` records what was delivered by reading it off the
worktree rather than carrying it from the reply — that is pattern B, and it is
right. The read is ``read_bytes().decode("utf-8", "surrogateescape")``, because
:func:`mcgyvr.deliver.deliver` writes through ``surrogateescape``
(``deliver._encoded``) and refuses *only* a lone surrogate, so a target holding a
byte that is not valid UTF-8 is committed successfully. A strict read would raise
``UnicodeDecodeError`` after the commit and before ``_write_record``; it is not a
``DeliveryError``, so the ``DeliveryError`` handler earlier in ``run_task`` would
not catch it, and the mission would end *"with earlier contracts already
committed and no record written"*.

The spelling is the one every other reader in this repository uses, as in
:meth:`mcgyvr.deliver.Accepted.read`, ``gate.changeset``, ``orchestrator.index`` — and
not, say, ``errors="replace"`` or a ``try``/``except`` that records a placeholder. Both
of those would let the run finish; both would also make the record's copy of the
delivered file a different sequence of bytes from the one in the commit beside it, which
is the substitution this whole pattern was written to close.

So the assertion here is on the **bytes**, not on the absence of an exception. A
test that only asked "did ``run_task`` return?" would pass against
``errors="replace"``, which is the wrong fix; it would also pass against a bare
``except UnicodeDecodeError: continue``, which is worse than the defect. What is
asserted is that the file in the commit and the string in
``MissionResult.files`` encode to the same bytes.

The control is the same run with ordinary ASCII content. It says the harness
below actually reaches the read-back — five stand-ins stand between a test and
that line, and a scaffolding mistake in any of them would produce a green test
that never executed the code under test.
