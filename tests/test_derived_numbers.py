"""The per-rig derived-numbers file, and the code held to it.

``tools/runs/derived.json`` is the single source of truth for the numeric
values mcgyvr measures on a rig rather than reads from the rig or from the
model: the runtime-resident intercept host-RAM sizing adds to spilled experts,
the per-rig card remainder ``vramfit``'s ``C`` subsumes, and the class
tolerances the fleet lock weighs NVMe against and a live probe is judged by.

This file holds the file to the same contract ``test_declared_host_state.py``
holds ``tools/runs/hosts.json`` to — every number states a value and why it is
that value, and an absent number is a named refusal, never a silent inline
default — and it holds the code to the file: the moved literals appear only
here, never as a source-of-truth literal in ``src/``. The class tolerances'
own resolution and refusal are in
``tests/test_a_live_probe_is_judged_against_its_lock.py``.
