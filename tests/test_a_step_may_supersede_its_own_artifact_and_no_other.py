"""Gate 5, the second rule: a step may supersede its own artifact and no other's.

Write-once (``# RUN_ARTIFACTS:``) refuses a step whose declared file is already
in the envelope, and two steps of the kernel-arms campaign run twice over one
file by design: ``1-build-ladder.sh`` writes its BUILD and KERNELS stamps before
step 3 has produced the instrument record and re-files the BENCH rows after it
(pass 2 rewrites the pass-1 file), and ``7-crash.sh`` appends to the file step
6 created (``# RUN_APPENDS:``). Through the door the first was refused until
the earlier file was moved aside by hand — a rule that gets waived on the rig
at 02:00, which is how a rule stops existing.

So a step may declare a file under ``# RUN_REWRITES:`` instead, and gate 5
(``05-envelope.py``) holds it to three things. An existing file is admitted
only if its ``### START`` carries a ``run_id`` whose ``<campaign>-<step>``
stem is this run's: the same step wrote it. Before the step starts, the file
is moved to ``<name>.superseded-<old run_id>.<ext>`` beside itself, so
nothing recorded is ever lost. A file another step wrote, or one with no run
id at all (the legacy shape), is refused with exit 2 naming the file and
nothing is moved: the door does not let one step overwrite another's
evidence, and cannot tell who wrote a file that never said. Gates 7 and 8
treat a rewritten file exactly as a write-once one — ``### RIGMOVED`` reaches
it, and it is parsed before exit 0.
