"""If the vLLM arms differ in two things, they measure neither.

The question is a capability one and it is asked *inside vLLM only*: Marlin's
sm75 path is ``mma.sync`` tensor-core PTX, which TU116 executes microcoded, so
does vLLM offer this card a path that is not that, and what does it cost? The
clean contrast holds the checkpoint fixed and moves only the kernel.

A reading that vLLM is slower than llama.cpp on srv1 and faster on srv2 is
**not** this hypothesis and is not evidence for it. The two engines differ in
scheduler, batching, KV management and quantisation format; such a ratio measures
two stacks. No row in this file may be compared with a llama.cpp row.

Two facts constrain the design. srv1 has already recorded ``--linear-backend
exllama`` refusing — ``ExllamaLinearKernel cannot implement due to: Quant t...``
in ``records/evidence/2026-08-24-knob-surface/surface.md`` — against an AWQ
checkpoint, which is the kernel rejecting uint4 rather than the flag being
absent; the flag itself is in v0.26.0 with ``exllama`` among its choices. And
srv1 holds no GPTQ file at all, so B2 sits behind a fetch and may still not come
up. So a test that demands a B2 ladder could only be made green by faking a row:
**a reasoned refusal is a result.**

Which is a claim about what the file *says*, not about what it omits. Guideline
8 buys B2 an exemption from the CONFIG rules its partner obeys, and the price of
that exemption is a REFUSED row that names the quant format it was offered,
carries the reason, and was believed only after three attempts. An arm that is
simply missing has paid nothing and is read as a gap, not a result.

The pool matters too. Under ``--gpu-memory-utilization`` the KV cache is whatever
survives the weights, so if the two kernels' scratch buffers differ the pools
differ, the width gate drops different rungs, and the comparison is between two
schedulers rather than two kernels.
