"""#210: the dataset builder's unit of identity is the (problem, language) arm.

#197 landed the problem pool as **paired arms** — one id names a contract in
both ``tools/problems/tasks/ts`` and ``…/py`` — and this builder was written
when the corpus was twenty TypeScript problems. These tests pin the two
invariants that paired arms make load-bearing:

- the ``--cap`` budget is per arm, so one language cannot consume a problem's
  whole allowance and leave the other with nothing;
- the validation split holds out whole *problems*, so a problem's two arms —
  near-translations of each other — never straddle train and val.

Plus the determinism the tool has always claimed: same inputs, same bytes,
regardless of the order ``golden.json`` happens to list its entries in.

The fixture is synthetic and tiny on purpose. The real corpus is asserted whole
by ``test_reply_corpus.py``; what is under test here is the curation, and a
curation bug is only visible when you control exactly which replies exist.
