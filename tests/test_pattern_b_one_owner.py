"""Pattern B — the tree owns the bytes, and one seam commits them.

Pattern B: *"Nothing owns the bytes"* is what happens when several modules
write file content and disagree about where truth lives.
:func:`mcgyvr.deliver.deliver` re-runs the gate over the bytes on disk, inside
the repository lock, immediately before staging, so a caller holding a string
cannot commit it under a verdict reached on something else. A second delivery —
a runner that wrote a carried string into its worktree and committed it itself —
would apply no bar: no re-gate, no digest, no lock. The rule this file holds is
therefore not "carry the bytes more carefully" but:

    The tree is the owner. Content never travels as a value, and one seam
    commits.

``tools/missions/run.py`` delivers through :func:`mcgyvr.deliver.deliver`, handed
the binding minted inside the workspace its gate ran in — the only place it
can be minted, because that sandbox is torn down before the climb returns.

Two of these tests assert the runner's own delivery helpers are gone rather
than driving them. The other two are the guard that stops a second
delivery growing back, and the control that says none of this is merely a
refusal.
