"""The seam the one-door tests drive ``python -m mcgyvr.serving.run`` through.

``src/mcgyvr/serving/run.py`` is the one access point to the rigs. A test may
not touch a rig, and the door has no variable that names a substitute for a
reading — the archived door's three seam variables left with it
(``tests/test_no_retired_door_names.py`` spells them), because a variable
that replaces a reading is a variable that skips one. What the door DOES have
is a PATH: it puts its own ``ssh`` and ``docker`` shims first, and each shim,
having admitted the host, execs the NEXT binary of that name on PATH. So a
test stands an ``ssh`` and a ``docker`` of its own behind the shims, in a
directory the door's environment leads with, and answers by the remote
command it is handed.

Everything here is built around one idea: a :class:`Scenario` is what an
operator would type, and :func:`door` is the only code that knows how that
becomes an argv. A test never spells ``--host`` itself.

The fixture (:func:`fixture_repo`) is a throw-away checkout the door can be
run FROM — it is invoked as ``python <fixture>/src/mcgyvr/serving/run.py``,
because the door derives its repo root from its own file — holding:

* a copy of ``src/mcgyvr/serving/`` (the door, its gates and its shims) and of
  ``tools/bench/product.py``; every other entry of ``product.SURFACE`` exists
  as a stub so gate 1's digest can be taken; ``rounds.json`` is written LAST,
  pinning that digest, so gate 1 admits the tree as built;
* ``tools/runs/`` minus the campaigns (``hosts.json``, ``rows.py``,
  ``workload.py``, ``_common.sh``, the drivers), so the tests own the campaign
  list; the tree is ``git init``ed because ``_common.sh`` locates the repo
  with ``git rev-parse`` when ``RUN_REPO`` is unset — and the door refuses
  ``RUN_REPO`` from the calling shell like every other ``RUN_*``;
* ``stubs/``, first on the PATH :func:`door_env` builds: the ``ssh`` reads the
  rig-snapshot request off its command line and answers from
  ``snapshot.txt`` (or ``snapshot-moved.txt`` once a flag file the test names
  exists — the reading srv1 gave after a hard lock wiped its BIOS profile), the
  geometry read from ``geometry.json`` (one row seeded from a recorded
  envelope), and the rest with canned lines; the ``docker`` logs every argv it
  is handed and answers ``info``, ``version``, ``image inspect`` and ``ps``.

The driver-seam tests do not go through the door: :func:`bare_env` puts the
same two stubs on PATH with ``RUN_HOST`` set. A driver and the emitter's two
rig-reaching functions prove the door before anything else, though, so a
test that must get PAST that proof runs them under :func:`fake_door` — a
stand-in whose path ends in ``mcgyvr/serving/run.py``, which is what
``gatelib.under_door`` reads off /proc — with ``RUN_ROOT`` naming this tree
and ``RUN_BIN`` its shim directory, where the emitter finds the real shims by
path.
