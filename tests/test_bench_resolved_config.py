"""The resolved serving configuration, and the refusal it makes possible (#358).

**The canary this file exists for is the last item of #358's definition of done:**
*"two rows differing only in a resolved field, and the contrast declines them. A
gate nobody has watched refuse is a gate nobody knows works."* That case is
:func:`test_two_rows_differing_only_in_a_resolved_field_are_refused`, and it does
not build its two digests from fixtures — it computes them from the two rigs'
own startup logs and ``/server_info`` payloads, committed under
``records/evidence/2026-08-24-resolved-config/``.

**What those two payloads are.** One image digest
(``vllm/vllm-openai:v0.26.0``), one model, one identical argument list
(``--max-model-len 8192 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.85 --max-num-seqs 16
--enforce-eager``), launched on srv1 and on srv2 on 2026-08-24. Both servers
answer ``vllm 0.26.0``. srv1 resolved ``TRITON_ATTN`` and the torch sampler;
srv2 resolved ``FLASH_ATTN`` and FlashInfer. Nothing in the record could say so
before this issue, and `serving_semantic_sha256` — the digest taken over
``/server_info`` — cannot say so now: that surface carries
``linear_backend='auto'`` on both and no attention or sampler key at all.

**A correction to #358's body, which this measurement supersedes.** The issue
states the divergence as srv1 ``float16`` against srv2 ``bfloat16``. On this
model both rigs resolve ``torch.float16``; the dtype claim came from a different
cell in the phase-0 evidence and does not hold for the 1.5B AWQ pair. The
divergence is real and it is the attention backend and the sampler, which is
what the canary keys on.
