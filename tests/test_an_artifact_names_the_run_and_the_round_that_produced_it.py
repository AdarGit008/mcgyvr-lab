"""Gate 6: an artifact says which run made it, and under which product round.

``srv1-vllm-arms.tsv`` opens with ``### WORKLOAD``, ``### START`` and ``### RIG``
(``records/evidence/2026-09-02-srv1-kernel-arms/srv1-vllm-arms.tsv``) and
nothing in it says which invocation produced it or which revision of the
product was checked out when it did. A file produced through the door carries
both: ``### START ... run_id=<RUN_ID>`` (from ``start_stamp``) and a
``### ROUND id=<round> product_sha256=<hex>`` stamp (from ``round_stamp`` in
``tools/runs/_common.sh``, fed by the two values gate 1 exported as ``RUN_ROUND`` and
``RUN_PRODUCT_SHA256`` after ``product.require_pinned()`` passed).

The parser holds the pair together: ``rows.read`` exposes ``sweep.round`` and
raises when a ``### START`` carries ``run_id=`` but no ``### ROUND`` follows —
a door-produced file with no round is a broken emitter, not an old file. Files
without ``run_id=`` are the legacy shape and parse without one; their
``round`` is empty. A file with ``run_id=`` is also held to the stamp rules at
read time (a loose token in ``### END`` is a parse error, not a truncation),
which is what gate 8 relies on.
