"""Offline invariants over #167's Python arm — the control for the null.

The JS/TS bundle measured flat, and the finding had to be scoped because one
control could not be run: the own Python ladder against a reachable rig. Two
readings fit the data and they have opposite consequences. Under *language*,
``prompts/python.md`` keeps its evidence and only the JS/TS port is unsupported.
Under *serving stack*, the Python bundle's measurement does not describe the
stack mcgyvr dispatches on and its standing is no better than the JS/TS one.

The arm that separates them is the twenty tasks, recovered from local-ai
and ported to mcgyvr contracts, run through the same rig the JS/TS sweep used.
What is checkable without a worker is whether that port is honest, and these are
the ways it could quietly not be:

* **The tasks could drift from the ones that were measured.** The acceptance
  scripts and reference solutions are copied from the vendored instrument, so a
  digest holds them to it. A task set that had been *rewritten* would still look
  like a replication and would not be one, which is the failure #167 says is
  worse than not running the control at all.
* **The composition could stop matching the JS/TS arm's.** A rate compared
  across arms is only about language if the mix it averages over is the same.
* **c2 could stop being the shipped bundle.** Here that equality runs the
  opposite way from the JS/TS arm's — ``prompts/python.md`` was derived *from*
  the measured ``c2.md``, not the other way round — so the file this arm uses as
  a condition is the vendored one, and this asserts the shipped prompt still
  equals it.

The rig's ``--selftest`` runs every reference against its own acceptance and is
the precondition for a sweep. It needs no worker; neither does anything here.
