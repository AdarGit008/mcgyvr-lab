"""A review prints the prompt, the reply and how it landed — and nothing else.

The whole reason the live journal keeps text is that someone can read what the
product dispatched and judge it: a number says a rung answered, and only the
prompt beside the reply says whether the answer was any good.
``tools/live/review.py DIR [--outcome X] [--orchestrator ID]`` is that reader:
one prompt/reply/outcome triple per matching attempt, out of the journal
directory alone — the ``*.jsonl`` files and ``blobs/``, with no index built
first.

The filter is the pin as much as the printing. A reviewer asking for the
rejected attempts who is handed the accepted ones too has to re-do the filter
by eye over prompts that run to pages, and a review nobody can narrow is a
review nobody runs.
