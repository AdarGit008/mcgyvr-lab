"""A value that was computed must arrive in the record.

The defect shape these tests hold shut: **the instrument measures the right
thing and the value does not survive the hand-off to the file** — a return value
never assigned, a field the row builder does not name, a duration printed to a
log and not to a journal.

A check that a *source file contains a string* confirms the thermometer was
installed and cannot notice that nobody wrote the temperature down. These tests
assert the other half, against the artifact rather than against the source: for
each producer→sink pair, every key the producer returns is **accounted for** in
the row the sink writes — carried, flattened, or DECLARED dropped with a reason.
Adding a field to a producer without deciding its disposition turns this red: it
fails on what is *missing* rather than on what is present.

The dispositions live beside the sinks they describe, not here. A test that
carried its own copy of the answer would be a second hand-written field list,
which is the defect.
