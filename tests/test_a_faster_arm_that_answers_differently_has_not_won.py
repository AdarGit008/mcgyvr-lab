"""Speed is only half of a verdict, and this repo has no perplexity harness to
give the other half a false comfort — it has something better.

The arms deliberately run different kernels. Different reduction order gives
different logits: with the same prompts at ``temperature: 0``, two arms can
report different ``otok`` and ``early_stop`` counts on the same cell. Arms that
do different amounts of work need a check that they did the same *work*.

The instrument exists and is stronger than token identity:
``tools/breadth/measure.py --endpoint ... --protocol openai --tier bench-py``
drives a 257-problem paired corpus through the production gate, and
``tools/bench/null.py`` compares two runs by ``candidate_sha256`` while separating
**sampler drift** (different bytes) from **acceptance drift** (identical bytes
scoring differently). ``STOP_CONDITION_PP`` is its adoption bar, and
``tools/bench/reproducibility.json`` carries a measured null.

The catch, and the reason for the second test: that bound's matching rule
requires ``serving_build`` to match, and every arm here is a new build. No
committed bound covers them. Each arm prices its own null first.
