"""One door, ``python -m mcgyvr.serving.run`` — and the tree is scanned to prove it.

A design that says "one door" and never looks is true of an afternoon, not of the
instrument. The door is ``src/mcgyvr/serving/run.py``. It reaches no rig itself: it runs
the gate scripts in order, on a PATH whose ``ssh`` and ``docker`` are the shims under
``gate-scripts/bin``, and the one rule — a rig is reached under the door, and only to
the host the door was opened for — lives in ``gatelib.ssh`` and in the shims, which call
it. So the complete set of places a rig is touched from is small, and it is declared
HERE, each with a reason, so a new way to reach a rig has to be argued in a diff rather
than slipped in as a file.

THE ACCEPTED LIMIT, in one sentence: the proof every gate, step and driver
applies is an ancestor's command line plus RUN_HOST, both of which an
operator can forge with ``bash -c ... x/mcgyvr/serving/run.py``, so the seal
is against every code path in this repository and not against an operator
impersonating the door.

The tripwires, each a scan over the tree:

1. An ssh (or scp/rsync/sftp, a paramiko/fabric/asyncssh import, ``/usr/bin/
   ssh``, ``command -p ssh``) or a ``docker run`` appears in a code line only
   behind the door. A SPAWN, not the seam's name: a test that substitutes
   ``servelib.ssh``, and the stdlib result record a stub hands back, are the
   opposite of reaching a rig, and the scan reads those two spellings for
   what they are (``SEAM_MENTION``) instead of taking the bare word — while
   still scanning the whole of the rest of every such line.
2. Nothing under ``tools/`` or ``src/`` names its own daemon: no
   ``DOCKER_HOST``, no ``docker -H``/``--host``/``--context``, no ``-H ssh://``
   outside the shim, and no ``env -u``/``env -i`` that would strip the
   door's vocabulary.
3. No driver or campaign step measures ``localhost``: the container runs on
   the rig, and a client that polls this machine's loopback measures nothing.
4. The archived door's seam variables are gone from src, tools and tests.
5. The serving harness run bare — outside the door — exits 2 naming the door.
6. The workload (``PROMPT_DECILES``) is defined once, in
   ``tools/runs/workload.py``.
7. Every started artifact under ``records/evidence`` parses with
   ``tools.runs.rows.read``, and one that names a ``run_id`` also names its
   round.
8. Every host that wrote a row has a declared ``rig`` block in
   ``tools/runs/hosts.json``.
9. The retired entry points are gone.
10. A hand-set ``RUN_*`` environment admits nothing: a campaign step, the
    emitter's rig read, every driver, every gate script and the default
    step, given every variable the door would export and no door ancestor,
    exit 2 naming the door before an ``ssh`` or ``docker`` stub sees a line.

#: Two spellings in which the seam's NAME provably starts no process, erased from a line
#: before the spawn patterns read it. The list form above sees ``"ssh",`` and cannot
#: tell ``subprocess.run(["ssh", host])`` from a test taking that very call OUT of the
#: path. Both here are the second kind, and each is anchored on the construct that makes
#: it so:
#:
#: 1. ``monkeypatch.setattr(<module>, "ssh", fake)`` — pytest's fixture,
#:    REPLACING the seam. The opposite of reaching a rig, and the reason a
#:    probe test can substitute ``servelib.ssh`` and touch no machine.
#: 2. ``CompletedProcess(args=["ssh", host], returncode=..., ...)`` — the
#:    stdlib's RESULT record, which a stub hands back in place of a call that
#:    was never made. It is a plain container; running one is not among the
#:    things it can do. Two anchors, either of which settles it on its own:
#:    the constructor named on the line, or a ``returncode=`` beside the argv,
#:    which no spawning API in the stdlib accepts — ``subprocess.run`` and
#:    ``Popen`` both raise ``TypeError`` on it. So the second reads the
#:    constructor wrapped over two lines, which is how black formats it.
#:
#: Only the matched text is erased, never the file's text around it — deleting
#: more would hide a real spawn written the same way — and the whole of the rest
#: of the line is still scanned. An argv, a command string or a
#: second seam anywhere else on the line survives the erasure and is still a
#: hit, INCLUDING inside the substitute itself:
#: ``monkeypatch.setattr(servelib, "ssh", lambda h: run(["ssh", h]))`` is
#: caught on its second ``"ssh",``. Neither spelling can be reached by
#: accident either: a bare ``setattr`` is not exempt, only ``monkeypatch.``'s,
#: and both require the seam to be the FIRST element of the argv, so
#: ``run(args=["env", "ssh", h])`` is untouched. The substitution is
#: deliberately single-line: one wrapped over two leaves ``servelib, "ssh",
#: rig`` alone on one of them and is a hit, which is the safe way to fail.
