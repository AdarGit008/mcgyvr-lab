"""``RUN_ID`` names one door invocation, so no two invocations may mint one.

``RUN_ID`` is ``<date>-<campaign>-<step>[-<suffix>]``, it is the token a
``### START`` carries, the prefix every container is named with and the key a
``### RIGMOVED`` or a refusal is filed under. A gate 5 that let a
``RUN_REWRITES`` step run twice on one day with no ``--suffix`` would leave the
superseded file and its successor carrying the same ``run_id``, two
measurements under one id, and refuse only a THIRD run — with a message
stating the rule the second had already broken.

So gate 5 (``05-envelope.py``) refuses to supersede a file whose ``run_id``
equals the id this run is about to mint: the re-run needs ``--suffix``.
Nothing is moved, the step does not start.
