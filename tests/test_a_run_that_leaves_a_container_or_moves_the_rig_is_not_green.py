"""Gate 7: teardown — the containers are gone and the rig reads as it started.

A hard lock can wipe the BIOS profile, and it takes the ssh pipe with it, so
the run whose end state is unknown is exactly the one that ended silently
(``test_a_row_without_the_rigs_live_state_is_not_comparable``). A step
compares its own start and end readings and the comparison lives inside the
step; a step that dies before ``end_stamp`` compares nothing. The door owns
the trap (gate 7, ``07-teardown.py``): after the step, whatever its exit,
``docker ps`` filtered by the run's names must be empty, and a fresh reading
of the rig must equal the one gate 2 took before the step. A leftover
container is exit 1 naming it; a rig that moved is ``### RIGMOVED`` appended
to the artifact and exit 1 — the file must say so, because the rows in it
were produced under two machines.
