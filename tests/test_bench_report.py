"""The matrix report, and the two comparisons it refuses to make (#113).

A report is where a number stops being a row and starts being quotable, so the
things worth pinning are the refusals rather than the formatting:

* a cell whose manifest cannot name a model, a rig and a bar gets no rate — a
  pass rate that names nothing is not a result;
* two cells that differ in anything but their condition are not laid beside
  each other: folding a backend change into a weights contrast is the defect.

And two absences must be stated rather than defaulted:

* the interaction term is **absent** rather than zero when a single-lever arm is
  missing, because zero is a finding and absence is not;
* the reproducibility bound is **not declared** rather than omitted when no null
  has been measured for this model, tier, bar and build — a delta smaller than
  an undeclared drift is not a small effect, it is an unknown one.
