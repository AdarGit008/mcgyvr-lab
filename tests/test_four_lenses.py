"""The four lenses as checks rather than as reading.

A defect found by a person or an agent re-reading is found one instance at a
time; a sweep that corrects every known instance and adds no check leaves the
next one to be found the same way.

So these are deliberately not assertions about known instances. Each one computes a
*population* and compares it against a declared allowlist, which means a new
instance fails the build even though nobody wrote it down. The allowlists are
the audit's findings, frozen: an entry is a fact of record, and removing one is
how a fix is proved.

Four classes, one check each:

* **the twin constant** — one value, two definitions, and only a comment
  holding them equal. ``test_duplicated_constants_are_declared``.
* **the unmapped rung** — a declared bar naming rungs the gate cannot emit, so a
  manifest records a bar nothing applied.
  ``test_declared_rungs_name_emitted_checks``.
* **the unjoined field** — recorded on every task and read by no analysis, so
  the capture was never the gap. ``test_recorded_task_fields_have_a_reader``.
* **the underived constant** — a shipped number citing a measurement no test
  recomputes, so the figure and its evidence drift apart.
  ``test_estimate_reserve_is_derived``.

The cost of a wrong allowlist entry here is not a missed defect; it is a
published number nobody can re-derive.
