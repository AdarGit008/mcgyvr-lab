"""Every llama.cpp serving declaration, checked before a rig is touched.

**Why these checks and not others.** Three of this backend's failure modes do
not raise, do not warn, and do not look like failures in the recorded row --
they produce a plausible number that means something other than what the column
says. A campaign that ranks engines on those numbers ranks its own
misconfiguration. Each is asserted here, at config time, where a fix costs a
line rather than a re-run:

1. ``--parallel`` below the ramp's widest level. ``llama-server``'s default is
   **four** slots. At the default, n=8 aggregate throughput comes out flat
   against n=4's while latency doubles, and ``--parallel 8`` lifts the same
   cell. The flat reading is the exact shape of hardware saturation, from a flag
   that did not take.

2. ``ctx_per_slot`` below the completion budget. ``-c`` is TOTAL and the server
   divides it across slots, so ``-c 4096 --parallel 8`` is 512 tokens per slot
   against a 475-token completion -- 37 left for the prompt. The generation is
   truncated, the server answers 200, and the row reads as a slow model.

3. A GGUF past the mmap budget. Nothing refuses it: the model loads, thrashes,
   and reports a disk benchmark as a decode throughput.

The backend enforces all three at launch. These are the same checks one layer
earlier, so a typo fails in a second instead of after a teardown.
