"""A live row names what answered it, what it was asked, and under which round.

``tools/bench/identity.py`` states what a measurement records — four groups,
one block. A journal row that said only ``rung`` and ``model`` could not be laid
beside a bench cell, because it would not say which endpoint served it, which
system prompt it carried or which product revision dispatched it. So each live
row carries the identity fields it can know at dispatch time:

* ``endpoint``, ``model``, ``protocol``, ``condition == "stock"``,
  ``orchestrator``, ``rung``, ``bundle_sha256`` (the system prompt, hashed the
  way ``tools/bundle/measure.py`` hashes it) — always;
* ``round`` and ``product_sha256`` — when the process runs inside this repo
  checkout, read from ``tools/bench/product`` loaded by path the way
  ``tools/breadth/measure.py`` loads it. Off-round is NOT refused for live
  work (the reader flags it), so the digest recorded is the tree's, whether or
  not it matches the open round's pin.

Absent-is-honest applies to the last pair: an install that is not this checkout
has no round to name, and a row that carried ``round: null`` or a made-up id
would read to ``product.declare`` as a run that recorded something.
