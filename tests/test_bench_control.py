"""The positive control, read at a tier it was not written for (#231 check 5).

Check 5 asks for *"the same battery, a different model, no redesign"*. That is a
property of the tools, not just of the runs: a control that can only be pointed
at one model forces a copy for the second tier, and once there are two copies
"no design change" is no longer something a reader can check.

Two things this file pins:

* the run directories are **arguments with pre-registered defaults**, so the
  1.5B invocation is unchanged and a second tier needs no new file;
* the reproducibility bound is **looked up per tier**
  (``control.declared_bound``, from ``tools/bench/reproducibility.json``), not
  carried as a module constant: one model's bound annotating another tier's
  contrast borrows a null that does not transfer. A higher-pass-rate model has
  more cells near the acceptance boundary and therefore its own null.
