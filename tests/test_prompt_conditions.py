"""The scaffold ablation (#225): one named condition, and it is run identity.

The bench's driver question — what actually makes a problem hard for the
floor model — was first asked as two separately authored cohorts, and that
design could not answer it: unpaired comparisons spend power like two
independent samples, which is the wall in a new costume
(`tools/bench/strata.json`, block 3). The paired form asks the same question
of *one* problem under two renders, so the discordant pairs carry the power.

`noscaffold` is that render: it empties `target_content`, which is the single
field `render_user_message` turns into the "CURRENT CONTENT OF <target>"
section. The problem, the interface, the stop conditions and the checker are
untouched — only how much code the model must produce moves.

What these tests hold is the part that is easy to get wrong and expensive to
discover later: that the ablation removes exactly one section and nothing
else, that it is refused as a *silent* variation by being written into
run.json (`bundle_sha256` hashes the system prompt, so a user-message
ablation is invisible to it), and that a directory measured under one
condition refuses the other — the cap's own argument, which this project
already applies to a resume across output caps.
