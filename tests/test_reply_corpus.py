"""The golden corpus: every captured worker reply, asserted whole.

The corpus is the raw reply files the measurement rigs write under
``records/measurements/``; ``records/corpora/worker-replies/golden.json`` pins
what ``parse_reply`` said about each one, with the stop reason it said it
under. These tests recompute the whole document from disk — every file found,
every sha, every verdict — and diff it against the pinned copy, which is one
golden comparison over the full set rather than a curated fixture per test:
a per-test selection drifts toward the shapes the curator understood.

What a failure means: a new run captured replies nobody pinned (run
``tools/replies/pin.py`` and commit the diff), a reply file was edited or lost
(corpus rot — restore it), or the parser's verdict on a real reply moved
(re-pin *deliberately*, with the change in review). All three are events this
suite exists to make loud.
