"""What the live-journal tests share: a repo, a ladder, a contract, a script.

Every test of ``mcgyvr run``'s journal drives ``mcgyvr.cli.main`` — the real
entry point — with ``drive.dispatch`` scripted so no endpoint is reached and
everything between the flag and the row (config, route, sandbox, prompt, parse,
gate) is real. The helpers here are the ones
``tests/test_a_recorded_run_is_written_under_the_orchestrator_that_ran_it.py``
wrote for itself, lifted so that the tests of *who* ran, *where* the journal
went and *how* the work landed do not carry four private copies each.

The environment is the seam. ``mcgyvr run`` reads ``CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID``
and ``PI_SESSION_FILE`` to name the session that typed it, and this test
process runs inside one of those sessions, so :func:`clean_env` empties both
and points ``HOME`` at a directory nobody else writes to — a test that forgot
would journal under the developer's real state dir as the developer's real
session.
