"""A fleet.yaml the lock accepts is a fleet.yaml a run can read.

``mcgyvr fleet lock`` requires every unit to carry its ``unit_id``, and
``mcgyvr.fleet.files`` accepts it. ``mcgyvr.config`` validates the same file
again for ``run``, ``pool``, ``emit`` and ``serve``; if it refused
``unit_id``, every locked setup would be unreadable by the commands that serve
it.
