"""The responsiveness read's arithmetic and its refusals (#225).

Like the ablation report beside it, a defect here would not crash — it would
publish a number. Three things are worth pinning, and each is checked against a
computation that does not share code with the thing it checks:

* **Fisher's p** decides the pre-registered tranche comparison. It is checked
  against an explicit enumeration of the label assignments, which is the
  permutation argument the hypergeometric formula is a shortcut for.
* **The classification** decides `psi_draw`, and a cell miscounted as pinned is
  a cell silently written off. Checked exhaustively over every verdict pattern.
* **The completeness rule** is what makes "no pass in nine draws" mean anything
  at all. A cell short a draw must be dropped, not scored — otherwise the
  pinned-fail count grows with every draw that failed to dispatch.
