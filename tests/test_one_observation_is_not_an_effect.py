"""Nine single observations against a demonstrated 6.2% noise floor.

Every rung in the 2026-09-01 A/B is one batch, once. At n=1 that is one HTTP
request. And the measured spread between nominally identical stock cells — same
rig, same image, same hour — reaches 6.2% at n>=4, because the prompt draw
desyncs whenever the level list differs.

So: five replicates, interleaved rather than blocked (the existing A/B ran all of
one arm and then all of the other, perfectly confounding arm with elapsed time
and card temperature), an A/A null to price the instrument, and a pre-registered
decision rule that refuses to call anything smaller than the noise an effect.

The draws must match position-for-position across arms, and the test asserts that
directly rather than trusting the procedure: two rows are comparable only if the
work they were *asked* for is equal — ``ptok`` and ``otok_req``.

Not ``otok``. That is what came back, and the arms deliberately run different
kernels: the 2026-09-01 A/B reads ``otok`` 214 against 221 on one cell at
``temperature: 0``. Demanding equality there would forbid the very finding
``test_a_faster_arm_that_answers_differently_has_not_won`` is there to score.
Guideline 2 is about draw sync; correctness is scored through the gate, not by
counting tokens.
