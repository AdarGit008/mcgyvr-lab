"""An index over the journal folds the corrections in and never rewrites the journal.

The journal is append-only for two reasons its module states — several
orchestrators can write one sink, and a crash mid-write loses one line — and
those hold only as long as nothing else opens the file for writing. A reviewer
wants the opposite shape: one row per attempt with its final outcome already
applied and the prompt and reply beside it as text. That shape is a separate
artifact, ``tools/live/index.py DIR``
building ``DIR/index.sqlite`` from every ``*.jsonl`` under ``DIR`` with
``telemetry.fold`` applied and the blobs joined by hash, so the journal stays
what it is and the review reads a derived table.

What is pinned: one row per **folded** attempt, so a correction is a column and
not a second row and an orphan correction is not an attempt; the latest
correction wins, in file order, exactly as ``fold`` decides; ``prompt_text`` /
``reply_text`` are the blobs' bytes and not their names; the build is idempotent
— running it twice yields the same rows — and the ``.jsonl`` files are
byte-identical before and after, which is the read-only property spelled as an
assertion about the filesystem.
