"""Offline invariants over #144's JS/TS condition ladder and its task set.

The measurement itself needs a worker; none of this does. What is checkable
without one is whether the *instrument* is sound, and that is where the mistakes
that would silently spoil a run actually live:

* **c2 must be the shipped bundle, byte for byte.** This is the property that
  makes a future result quotable about ``prompts/javascript.md`` rather than
  about a file resembling it — the same rule
  ``test_worker_prompt.py`` holds for Python's ``c2.md``. A drift here would not
  fail the sweep; it would produce numbers describing a prompt nobody ships.
* **The ladder must stay nested.** The conditions are cumulative — c1 is
  c2's opening, c2 is c3's — so a condition is *only* a size. If an edit made
  c1 differ from c2's first section in wording as well as length, the ladder
  would be measuring two variables and reporting one.
* **The task set must be dispatchable by this project.** Every contract goes
  through the real loader, and every target must be owned by the JS/TS adapter,
  because a task whose contract mcgyvr rejects or whose target selects no bundle
  is not measuring the shipped path.

The tests that run acceptance are marked and skip where it cannot run, and the
predicate is the rig's own ``node_runs_typescript()`` rather than "is Node
installed". Acceptance imports ``solution.ts``, so a Node without type
stripping is not a Node these tests can use — a presence check let them fail on
the runner instead of skipping. The full reference-vs-acceptance selftest is the
rig's ``--selftest``, run before any sweep.
