"""Run identity, and the two ways a table is refused (#265).

The acceptance item this file exists for is *"a manifest mutated in any identity
field is refused by the guard, proven by a test per field"* — so the parametrised
case below iterates :data:`identity.KEY` itself rather than a list written out
here. A field added to the key without a mutation that refuses is a test failure,
which is the only arrangement under which the coverage claim stays true after
the next lane edits the key.

The second refusal is the one the old guard did not make. It compared
``manifest.get(key)`` across cells, so a field **no cell carried** yielded one
value and passed — `round` and `product_sha256` are the live case, carried by 6
of the 139 manifests on disk. Absence agreeing with absence reads as having
checked, and every pre-round table was reading that way.
