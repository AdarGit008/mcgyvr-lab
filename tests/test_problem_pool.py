"""Offline invariants over the problem pool (#197).

Admission itself executes checkers and needs `node` and `python` in the shape
the contracts declare; none of that belongs in the suite, the same way the
rigs' `--selftest` is a stated precondition rather than a test. What the
suite holds the repository to is everything checkable without running a
candidate:

* **The tree is the manifest.** Every pool task on disk is pinned byte for
  byte in ``admissions.jsonl``, and every pin either matches the tree or
  names its successor. Run directories pin the task set's digests, so an
  unpinned edit is not a tidy-up — it refuses prior runs a resume.
* **The id is the join key.** Directory name, contract id in both arms, and
  the ``p<nnn>-<slug>`` shape all agree, and no pool id collides with any
  other task set's — `tools/finetune/build_dataset.py` keys on the bare id.
* **The front door stays held out.** No pool problem implements a symbol
  whose normalised name is a HumanEval entry point, in either arm's casing.
