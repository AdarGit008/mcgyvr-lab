"""The ablation report's statistics, held against first principles.

A defect in these two functions would not crash anything — it would publish a
p-value, and a claim whose arithmetic nobody re-derived is costly to correct,
so both tests are checked against independent
computation rather than against a remembered formula.

The anchor worth naming: six problems that all moved the same way give
p = 0.0312 under both tests, and that is the best a six-pair comparison can
do. It is where the `m >= 6` wall comes from, and the report prints
`m` for every contrast so a result below it is visibly undecidable rather
than quietly weak.
