"""The redundancy read's arithmetic (#225).

Like the responsiveness read beside it, a defect here would not crash — it
would publish a number that decides whether 120 more problems get authored.
Three things are worth pinning, each against a computation that shares no code
with the thing it checks:

* **Fisher's p** is what separates "these two cells behave differently" from
  "the counts happen to differ". Checked against an explicit enumeration of the
  label assignments, which is the permutation argument the hypergeometric
  formula is a shortcut for.
* **The correlation** is the whole finding. Checked against series whose answer
  is known by construction, including the two degenerate cases that must return
  zero rather than divide by it.
* **The tranche derivation** decides which row a problem is reported in. A
  problem filed under a tranche it was not authored in would move a mean that
  an authoring decision is read from.
