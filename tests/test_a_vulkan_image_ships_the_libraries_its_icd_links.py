"""The Vulkan runtime image carries what the NVIDIA ICD needs to load.

With ``--gpus all -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all`` the NVIDIA toolkit
injects ``/etc/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json`` and ``libGLX_nvidia.so.0``.
That library links ``libX11.so.6``, ``libXext.so.6`` and
``libGLdispatch.so.0``, and the ICD's init opens ``libEGL.so.1``. A runtime
stage that installs ``libvulkan1`` and ``vulkan-tools`` under
``--no-install-recommends`` carries none of them, so the Vulkan loader says

    Failed loading library associated with ICD JSON libGLX_nvidia.so.0
    libXext.so.6: cannot open shared object file
    vkCreateInstance: Found no drivers!

— or, with the X11 three and no EGL, ``Could not get 'vkCreateInstance' via
'vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr'`` — and ggml falls back to the CPU. Upstream's
Vulkan image has EGL as a mesa dependency; ours has no reason to.

So the runtime apt line carries four packages and a build-time check that they
resolved, so an image that would silently bench the CPU fails to build. And the
arm's spec names them (``icd_deps=x11-egl``) so ``image_matches`` refuses to
reuse an image that lacks them: the ladder rebuilds A3 rather than
re-measuring the CPU under the same tag.
