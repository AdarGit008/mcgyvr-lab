"""The rig is held to its docker version, by gate 2 and again by gate 3.

The same image can list ``Vulkan0`` on one rig and bench the CPU on another,
with identical driver libraries injected, when the dockers differ: a docker
that routes ``--gpus all`` through the CDI spec mounts the NVIDIA Vulkan ICD
manifest, and one that routes it through the legacy hook does not. A comparison
between two rigs is only sound if something states which docker each runs.

``hosts.json[host].rig.docker`` states it. The reader gate 2 ships to the rig
(``rig-snapshot.sh:docker_version``) prints the daemon's version beside the
hardware and refuses rather than guesses when it cannot; gate 2 (``02-rig.py``)
compares it with the declaration like every other key. Gate 3 (``03-image.py``)
then asks the daemon the door's ``docker`` reaches — the rig's, over ``-H
ssh://HOST`` — for its name and version: the daemon a tag is resolved through
must be the machine gate 2 read, on the docker hosts.json declares.
