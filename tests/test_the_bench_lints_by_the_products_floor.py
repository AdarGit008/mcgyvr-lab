"""The bench judges a worker by the product's floor, not by this repo's own.

``tools/bench/score.py:lint_config`` exists because a synthetic one-file
workspace carries no ruff configuration, so ruff falls back to everything it
knows, and a stricter bar than the product's is the wrong bar.

The choice does not point at ``pyproject.toml``. This repository's selection
carries rules the product's floor does not: ``DEFAULT_RUFF_SELECT`` in
``src/mcgyvr/gate/adapters/python.py`` selects pycodestyle's ``E4``/``E7``/``E9``
rather than ``E``, so that E501 — the one selected rule ``ruff format``
structurally cannot satisfy — does not reject a docstring the formatter can
never wrap. A bench that derived its bar from ``pyproject.toml`` would select
``E``, and a worker reply the product would ship would score as a lint
rejection on the bench.

Reading ``pyproject.toml`` is the choice that fails here. It measures the
worker against *this repository's* house style, which nothing in a bench run is
about; a rule this project adds for its own prose would silently move every
published pass rate. The product floor is what a mcgyvr-managed repository that
declares nothing is actually gated by, which is exactly what a bench workspace
is.

The first test below is the load-bearing one: it runs the gate over a workspace
staged by the bench itself, so it asserts the configuration the bench *applies*
rather than the tuple it names. The tuple check follows only to catch a
restated copy, and would pass on its own against a bench whose applied bar was
wrong.
