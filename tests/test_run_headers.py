"""The run headers: intent, in a home that outlives the campaign that asked.

`run.json` records what a run WAS. Nothing recorded what a run is FOR — not the
question, not what it could have carried, not what was left on the table — and
D7's intent survived only as prose `_doc` keys in a config, a three-tuple of
shell commands in `launch.py`, and a dated evidence directory that would have
taken the questions with it. #322 decided the gate; #330 is the half that is
not the gate, and these are its checks.

Two of them are worth naming for what they refuse rather than what they assert.
:func:`test_a_header_carries_no_key_the_spine_does_not_name` is why free text
cannot leak into the aggregatable layer: prose goes under `notes` or nowhere,
because open questions dispersed over 147 session records is the state this
record type exists to leave behind. And
:func:`test_the_field_review_is_owed_once_ten_run_headers_exist` is the closing
condition made mechanical — a gate left open with no review date states no
property (lens 3), so the owed state is a non-zero exit rather than a
line in a record somebody has to remember to read.
