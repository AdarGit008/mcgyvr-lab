"""The cross-rig claim, turned into something that can refuse.

The width-16 ramp read srv2 far ahead of srv1 against a single stream, and the
campaign README concludes from it that "the gap is hardware, not configuration"
(`mcgyvr-lab/archive/docs/archive/evidence-prose/calibration-2026-08-19/README.md`),
resting on one controlled flag: `--enforce-eager` on both hosts. The owner's
hunch on record is the opposite — "something feels off — maybe config".

**Hardware may well be right.** The journal the sentence was read off,
`d7-ramp.jsonl`, names no card, no driver, no launcher, no engine build, no
weights digest and no engine config, and carries no launch row, so it cannot
support the claim; `records/evidence/2026-08-23-cross-rig/ramp.jsonl` can. A
claim nothing verifies is worse than dead weight, so this file makes the claim a
predicate instead of a sentence.

Three arms here, and none of them touches a rig:

* The launchers hand the engine the same arguments. srv1 runs `vllm serve` from
  a pip install and srv2 runs the `v0.26.0` container; the two code paths build
  their command lines separately, so this arm compares the two strings.
* :func:`cross_host_contrast` refuses a contrast whose two sides are not
  comparable — different weights, different engine build, or a card that never
  got named — instead of returning two numbers that look like an answer.
* The 2026-08-20 claim itself, read through that function off
  `records/evidence/2026-08-23-cross-rig/`: one width-16 ramp and one launch row
  per host, both launched through the container. The journal the claim was first
  read off carries no identity, and the function refuses it.

And one arm that is neither: the launcher a run DECLARES. srv1 holds both a pip
install and the same image digest srv2 pulls, and detection returns `pip` for
any host answering `command -v vllm` — so the contrast could not be put on one
launcher without a seam, and a `serving_build` naming only the package version
would not have caught the mismatch; `vllm.build` names the launcher as well.

What this file does NOT do is decide what the gap is. It makes the question
answerable by a measurement that carries its own conditions — and the answer it
reached is narrower than the sentence it checks: the deployment is out, and the
card and the driver, which move together across these two rigs, are not
separated by anything here.
