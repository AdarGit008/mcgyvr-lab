"""A rule in ``okf/must-read/touching-rigs.md`` that became a gate says which one.

Three of that file's rules are code checks the door runs
(``src/mcgyvr/serving/gate-scripts/``, ``run.py``'s SEQUENCE): prove
reachability is gate 2 (the live rig
compared with its declaration); ``img=`` on every srv1 row is gate 3 (a tag
resolved once to a digest, which is what the driver receives); kill what you
started is gate 7 (the trap that finds the run's containers gone and the rig
unchanged). A rule that is enforced by code and still reads as advice sends
the reader to do by hand what the door already refuses — or, worse, to do it
around the door. No new prose file: the pointer goes beside the rule, as
``→ gate N``, the way the file already points at evidence.
