"""The acceptance ceiling's evidence, and the two ways it could be read wrong.

`tools/bench/ceiling.py` produces the acceptance ceiling's figures. Two of its
steps are the kind that pass silently when they are wrong:

* **which rows are timeouts.** Two scorers wrote the corpus and they phrase it
  differently — the acceptance-only path says "timed out after 30.0s", `Gate.run`
  says the acceptance command "exceeded the task's time limit". Matching one
  phrasing puts 3 timeout rows into the *passing-candidate* population, and the
  slowest of them is the number the whole decision turns on.
* **which rows could have observed the disputed band.** A run measured at a 30 s
  ceiling cannot produce a row above it, so counting the [30, 120) band over the
  whole corpus reads 31,062 censored rows as evidence of emptiness. The
  uncensored subset has to be identified, and no manifest recorded a ceiling
  before #262, so it is identified from the rows themselves.
