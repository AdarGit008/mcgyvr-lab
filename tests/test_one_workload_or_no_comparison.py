"""Every driver in this campaign draws the same prompts, or nothing measured by
one may be compared with anything measured by another.

Matched prompts are necessary and never sufficient. They make two rows *honest* —
same text, same token counts — they do not make a llama.cpp row and a vLLM row
comparable. Those are different stacks (scheduler, batching, KV, quant format)
and no ratio across them attributes anything. What the digest guards is
comparability *within* an engine, across drivers.

The first test is the control: every driver in the tree draws its prompts from
the one workload module, and the module digests to the pin. The second asks each
run artifact to *name* the driver it ran under, so a reader can recompute rather
than trust a constant pasted into a header. An older artifact names a driver
by a path that has since moved. A stamp is a record, not a pointer to be edited
after the fact, so the name it carries is resolved through
``rows.driver_source`` (``rows.RECORDED_MOVES``) to the file whose block is
hashed now.

Over generated prompts, never over source text. A source hash moves under a
``ruff format`` pass, and a formatter must not be able to void a comparison.
