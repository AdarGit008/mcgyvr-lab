"""Gate 1: no arm ever reaches the rig under a round that does not pin its tree.

An arm measured on a tree three commits past the pin must not land in the same
table as one measured on the pin: every arm in a round runs against one
revision. A round is a boundary in the record, not a permission to work (owner
ruling), so gate 1 (``01-round.py``) does not refuse a moved tree: it calls
``tools/bench/product.ensure_open()``, which draws the boundary the moved tree
needs and lets the run through.

What is asserted here is therefore the guarantee and not the refusal: whatever
the door does with a moved tree, ``RUN_ROUND`` names a round whose
``product_sha256`` is this tree's, and the round that was open keeps the digest
its own arms ran against.

The fixture pins the tree it builds (``tests/onedoor.py:pin``); ``unpin``
declares a digest the tree does not have. Both values reach the step as
``RUN_ROUND`` and ``RUN_PRODUCT_SHA256``, and from there the artifact's
``### ROUND`` stamp
(``test_an_artifact_names_the_run_and_the_round_that_produced_it``).
