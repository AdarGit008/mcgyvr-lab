"""The bench's serving seam (#225): two tiers, manifest-pinned, bench half only.

The bench is the pool's serving pattern pointed at `tools/bench/`: the
language arm lives in the tier name, run identity (`tier` + `tasks_sha256`)
carries it, and the campaign driver never climbs into either. What is new is
the split — the manifest records each admitted problem's half under the
pre-declared rule, and only `split == "bench"` may ever reach a sweep. The
reserve half is #222's training capacity: never a tier, never served, and
its directories live outside the roots `tools/instruments.json` declares.
