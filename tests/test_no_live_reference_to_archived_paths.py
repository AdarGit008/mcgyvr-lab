"""No live file points at a path that moved into `archive/` or mcgyvr-lab.

Several prose, session and README paths moved to ``archive/`` (``docs/archive/
evidence-prose``, ``docs/archive/sessions``, ``tools/*/README.md``,
``forensic-ollama``), and on 2026-09-15 most of ``archive/`` moved on to
AdarGit008/mcgyvr-lab under the same paths (``okf/must-read/always.md``). A live
reference to the old path is a pointer at a file that is no longer there.
History is exempt (``archive/``, ``records/``, ``okf/``); the fix is to repoint
the citation at the file's ``archive/`` path while it is still in this
repository, or at ``mcgyvr-lab/<path>`` once it is in the lab, not to restore
the file.
