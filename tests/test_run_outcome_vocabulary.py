"""``ok`` must mean the cell measured what it was asked for.

D8 fixed the outcome vocabulary to four values -- ok / launch_failed /
ramp_failed / refused -- so that a terminal state is stated rather than inferred
from which fields happen to be missing. One case slipped through it:
``contract.ramp`` records per-request failures as ``errors`` and returns
normally, so a ramp in which whole levels produced no successful request raises
nothing and the row keeps the ``ok`` it was constructed with.

Measured on srv1 2026-08-30. The host lost power 137 seconds into
``m_dsv2-lcpp-srv1``'s n=2 level:

    n=1   14.5 s   ok=1  errors=0                 32.8 tok/s
    n=2  327.7 s   ok=0  errors=2  TimeoutError   -- power lost mid-level
    n=4  132.4 s   ok=0  errors=4  URLError       -- host was off
    n=8  132.4 s   ok=0  errors=8  URLError       -- host was off

That cell was journalled ``ok``. ``saturation_n`` had already refused it -- "only
level n=1 survived; a curve with one point has no saturation point" -- so the
condition was computed and then not allowed to reach the field that decides
what gets re-measured. ``--resume --retry-failed`` keys on the outcome and
skipped it as good, and any ladder built from ``ok`` rows would have read one
point as a curve.
