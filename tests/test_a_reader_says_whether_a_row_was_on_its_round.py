"""A reader says whether a row was on its round — and says nothing when it cannot.

A live attempt row carries ``round`` and ``product_sha256`` when the process
ran inside this checkout (:mod:`mcgyvr.telemetry`, *a row names what answered
it, and under which round*): the open round's id and the digest of the tree
that dispatched, whether or not that tree was the round's pinned tree. Off-round
is NOT refused for live work; the reader flags it instead: a row says which
round it was written under, and the reader says whether the tree was that
round's tree.

What is pinned. ``tools/live/index.py DIR`` gives ``attempts`` an ``off_round``
column: ``0`` when the row's ``product_sha256`` is the digest
``tools/bench/rounds.json`` pins for the row's ``round``, ``1`` when it differs,
``NULL`` when the row has no round to compare against or names one the file has
never opened. Absent-is-honest: a digest nobody can check is never coerced to a
verdict. ``tools/live/review.py DIR`` prints the same answer as a word in each
attempt's header line — ``on-round``, ``off-round`` or ``round-unknown`` — so
the reviewer reading a reply knows which product produced it.
